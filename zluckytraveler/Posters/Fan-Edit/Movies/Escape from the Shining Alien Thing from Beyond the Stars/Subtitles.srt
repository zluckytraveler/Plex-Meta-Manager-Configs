Is that a man in there or something?

00:30:46,692 --> 00:30:48,597
it can help bring your cholesterol down.

139
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:50,315
And they got numbers to show you that.

140
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:54,439
Now I'm going to tell you about something
they can't measure with numbers. OK?

141
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,495
I just plain feel better every day.

142
00:30:57,661 --> 00:31:00,172
As a matter of fact, most of the time
I feel terrific.

143
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:04,170
And to me, that's worth more that
all the numbers they got.

I don't know what the hell's in there,
but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.

159
00:34:45,357 --> 00:34:46,424
Bennings, go get Childs.

160
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:48,877
What is this? What's going on?

161
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:51,650
- Hey, Palmer, what is this?
- I don't know.

162
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:54,883
- Childs, Mac wants the flamethrower!
- Mac wants the what?

163
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:57,635
- That's what he said. Now, move!
- Damn it.

164
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:04,174
MUSIC: "Voodoo Child"
by Jimi Hendrix

165
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:13,493
- Stay back.
- Hey, Mac, what is it?

166
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,111
- Don't! No!
- Get away!

167
00:36:04,586 --> 00:36:06,272
Get back! Get back!

168
00:36:30,623 --> 00:36:31,934
Get your ass over here!

169
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:34,556
Burn it.

170
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:40,805
Damn it, Childs. Torch it!

171
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:38,799
Channel 20's world television
premiere of The Thing

172
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:42,686
starring Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley
will continue in just a moment.

173
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:09,655
The quiet moments belong to J&B.

174
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:17,121
The Scotch whiskey so rare, it whispers.

175
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:21,818
Chariots of the Gods.

176
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:23,945
The international bestseller by Erich Von Däniken

177
00:38:24,006 --> 00:38:26,865
that shattered conventional theories about
history and archeology.

178
00:38:27,355 --> 00:38:31,836
Now International brings it to
the screen in a startling new film.

179
00:38:32,182 --> 00:38:36,821
Chariots of the Gods explores Von Daniken's
controversial and explosive theory that

180
00:38:36,903 --> 00:38:40,270
beings from other galaxies
visited earth in ancient times.

181
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:43,411
Did a genius from another
world design the pyramids?

182
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:46,523
Is there evidence of a
prehistoric airfield in the Andes?

183
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:49,993
And what about the giant stone
faces that brood over Easter Island?

184
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,456
All over the earth the evidence is there.

185
00:38:52,687 --> 00:38:56,288
For an intriguing fascinating
mind-opening experience,

186
00:38:56,318 --> 00:38:58,940
see Chariots of the Gods.
Rated G.

187
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:12,528
Now back to The Thing starring Kurt Russell.

188
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:18,922
You see, what we're talking about here
is an organism

189
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:22,559
that imitates other life-forms,
and it imitates them perfectly.

190
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:28,159
You see when this thing attacked our dogs
it tried to shape its own cells to imitate theirs.

191
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,905
We got to it before it had time to finish.

192
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:32,645
Finish what?

193
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:36,423
Finish imitating these dogs.

194
00:39:37,482 --> 00:39:40,274
You're saying that that thing in the
ice was trying to become our dogs?

195
00:39:41,096 --> 00:39:41,459
Yeah.

196
00:39:42,362 --> 00:39:45,307
Seems to be able to imitate other life forms.

197
00:39:46,161 --> 00:39:47,029
So what's our problem?

198
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:49,070
The Thing's not dead yet.

199
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:52,262
Great.

200
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:56,615
What's it gonna do? Put itself
together and come chasing after us?

201
00:39:57,287 --> 00:40:01,049
Easy, easy. Good.

202
00:40:03,954 --> 00:40:05,726
Easy, easy.

203
00:40:11,684 --> 00:40:12,376
- Clark.
- Yeah?

204
00:40:13,254 --> 00:40:16,375
Did you notice anything strange
about the dog, anything at all?

205
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:17,935
Strange? No.

206
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:22,396
What was the dog doing in the rec room?

207
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:24,297
I don't know.

208
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,726
He was just wandering around camp all day.

209
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:33,529
Are you saying to me the dog wasn't put
in the kennel until last night?

210
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:34,581
Right.

211
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,344
How long were you alone with that dog?

212
00:40:40,094 --> 00:40:43,872
I don't know. An hour.
Hour and a half, maybe.

213
00:40:46,087 --> 00:40:47,847
What the hell you looking at me
like that for?

214
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:53,022
- I don't know.
- What?

215
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:55,990
I don't know. It's probably nothing.

216
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:00,729
It's nothing at all.

217
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:10,941
We will return to Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley
in The Thing right after these messages.

218
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:20,652
Starve a cold, feed the fever!

219
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:23,222
Feed the cold, starve a fever.

220
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,587
Starve a cold? Feed a cold?

221
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,988
Got a cold? The flu?

222
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,956
Doctors recommend aspirin to
relieve the ache, reduce the fever

223
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:36,145
Fluids, and rest when you can.
But remember all aspirin is not alike.

224
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:41,869
Bayer tested its aspirin against every leading
brand. For quality Bayer was shown superior.

225
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:46,304
That I can remember. Bayer.
To reduce the fever and relieve the ache.

226
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:50,965
EERIE MUSIC

227
00:42:09,074 --> 00:42:11,784
There's something out there.
It's after kids everywhere.

228
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:17,311
It entices them, confuses them
and can even kill them. That's right.

229
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,528
Illegal drugs are everywhere.

230
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:24,808
Cocaine coaxes you in and then
when you least expect it grabs you.

231
00:42:25,321 --> 00:42:27,738
You're hooked. And it's hard to get away.

232
00:42:28,277 --> 00:42:30,166
And have you've seen what marijuana does to some people?

233
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:33,744
Oh yeah. You've seen them. Total burnouts.

234
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:36,928
It slows you down. It softens your mind.

235
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:40,588
And in my neighborhood you
need to move quickly and think fast.

236
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:45,046
Drugs. It's a bloody shame.

237
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,992
Now back to The Thing starring Kurt Russell.

238
00:43:16,546 --> 00:43:17,918
How much more of this crap is there?

239
00:43:18,587 --> 00:43:20,312
I don't know.
About nine hours, I'd say.

240
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:23,692
We can't learn anything from this.

241
00:43:27,282 --> 00:43:28,232
Guess not.

242
00:43:39,162 --> 00:43:40,641
Where'd they take these shots?

243
00:43:42,365 --> 00:43:43,952
Seems like they were spending
a lot of their time

244
00:43:43,982 --> 00:43:46,905
in a little place northeast of their camp
about five or six miles.

245
00:43:46,935 --> 00:43:47,507
What's that?

246
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:18,290
RADIO DISTORTION NOISES

247
00:44:18,677 --> 00:44:20,649
GHOST PHONE RINGS

248
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:22,796
"Seven days"

249
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:30,284
Here. This is it. The place where
they were spending most of their time.

250
00:44:30,314 --> 00:44:33,110
- Pretty nasty out, Mac. 35 knots.
- Screw it. I'm gonna go up anyway.

251
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:45,612
Jesus, how long do you figure
this has been in the ice?

252
00:46:46,896 --> 00:46:49,958
Well, the backscatter effect's been
bringing things up

253
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:54,644
from way down around here
for a long time, I'd say

254
00:46:55,238 --> 00:46:58,265
I'd say the ice it's buried in is
100,000 years old, at least.

255
00:47:01,263 --> 00:47:03,481
- And those Norwegians blew it up?
- Yeah.

256
00:47:34,592 --> 00:47:35,971
I don't know.

257
00:47:36,073 --> 00:47:39,731
Thousands of years ago, it crashes,
and this thing...

258
00:47:40,512 --> 00:47:44,178
gets thrown out or crawls out,
and it ends up freezing in the ice.

259
00:47:44,596 --> 00:47:46,895
I just cannot believe
any of this voodoo bullstuff.

260
00:47:48,443 --> 00:47:50,907
Childs, it happens all the time, man.

261
00:47:51,707 --> 00:47:53,807
They're falling out of the skies like flies.

262
00:47:54,603 --> 00:47:56,246
Government knows
all about it. Right, Mac?

263
00:47:56,938 --> 00:47:58,698
Do you believe
any of this voodoo bullstuff, Blair?

264
00:47:59,402 --> 00:48:03,767
Childs. Childs. Chariots Of The Gods, man.

265
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,442
They practically own South America.

266
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:08,906
I mean, they taught the Incas
everything they know.

267
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:18,094
So, come on, now, MacReady.

268
00:48:18,411 --> 00:48:21,907
The Norwegians get a hold of this,
and they dig it up out of the ice.

269
00:48:21,937 --> 00:48:24,371
Yes, Garry, they dig it up. They cart it back.

270
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,831
It gets thawed out, wakes up,
probably not in the best of moods.

271
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:30,311
- I don't know. I wasn't there.
- Which one of you disrespectful men

272
00:48:30,381 --> 00:48:34,319
been tossing his dirty drawers
in the kitchen trash can, huh?

273
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:37,794
From now on I want my
kitchen clean, aight? Germfree.

274
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:40,514
Now how's this monkeyfellow wake up
after thousands of years in the ice?

275
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:43,337
- And how could it look like a dog?
- I don't know how.

276
00:48:44,613 --> 00:48:47,575
'Cause it's different than us, see?
'Cause it's from outer space.

277
00:48:47,605 --> 00:48:49,340
What do you want from me? Ask him.

278
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:56,071
You buy any of this, Blair?

279
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:02,700
<i>Mac, removing those things
out of the lab into the storeroom.</i>

280
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:03,610
<i>Can you come get your stuff?</i>

281
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:06,778
Be there in a minute, Doc.

282
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:25,329
Through the door.

283
00:52:30,002 --> 00:52:30,988
Right over here. Right over...

284
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,143
BENNINGS SIGHS WHINNGLY

285
00:52:35,307 --> 00:52:37,710
Sorry, Mac. You have to move your stuff...

286
00:52:38,506 --> 00:52:41,156
Doc says we gotta lock him up.
Stash him in here and lock him up.

287
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:44,557
- I have to talk to you.
- I'm tired of talking, Fuchs.

288
00:52:44,587 --> 00:52:46,480
I just wanna get up to my shack
and get drunk.

289
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,060
- Mac, it's important.
- What is it?

290
00:52:50,573 --> 00:52:53,027
- Outside.
- It's 40 below outside.

291
00:52:53,057 --> 00:52:55,535
In the Thiokol. Please, Mac.

292
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:15,943
- We ought to just burn these things.
- Can't burn the find of the century.

293
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:17,837
That's gonna win somebody the Nobel Prize.

294
00:53:31,484 --> 00:53:32,575
You got the keys?

295
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:35,459
Get them from Garry.
I wanna get some stuff out of here.

296
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:49,203
JAWS THEME PLAYS

297
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:12,094
There's something wrong with Blair.

298
00:54:12,763 --> 00:54:14,873
He's locked himself in his room,
and he won't answer the door.

299
00:54:16,114 --> 00:54:17,808
Let's go, Bennings. I gotta get some sleep.

300
00:54:54,815 --> 00:54:55,483
SOUND OF KEYS DROPPING

301
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,574
Go get the doc.

302
00:54:58,755 --> 00:55:00,314
I'll get Garry. We'll meet in Blair's room.

303
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,469
It's Bennings!

304
00:55:19,378 --> 00:55:22,118
Bennings was right there.
Mac, I swear to God. It had a hold of him.

305
00:55:35,802 --> 00:55:37,174
Windows! Windows! Keep away from him!

306
00:55:41,677 --> 00:55:42,662
Get back! Stay back!

307
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,054
He's not whining.

308
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:48,326
It isn't Bennings.

309
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:58,588
SCREAMS INHUMANELY

310
00:56:22,632 --> 00:56:25,235
- My God, what was happening to him?
- If it had more time to finish

311
00:56:25,265 --> 00:56:27,816
it would have looked,
sounded and acted just like Bennings.

312
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:28,848
I don't know what you're saying.

313
00:56:29,962 --> 00:56:32,553
That was one of those things out there
trying to imitate him, Garry.

314
00:56:37,713 --> 00:56:39,542
- Come on.
- MacReady, I know Bennings.

315
00:56:39,572 --> 00:56:42,199
I've known him for 10 years. He's my friend.

316
00:56:44,521 --> 00:56:46,245
We've gotta burn the rest of him.

317
00:56:49,446 --> 00:56:52,401
MUSIC: "Burn the flames"
by Roky Erickson

318
00:57:20,384 --> 00:57:21,509
All step back.

319
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,054
You sure that's all of them?

320
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,108
We cleaned out the storehouse, the lab.
There is nothing left.

321
00:57:54,442 --> 00:57:55,263
Where's Blair?

322
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,574
I can't find Blair.

323
00:58:40,605 --> 00:58:41,309
Where's everybody else?

324
00:58:42,247 --> 00:58:44,138
Windows is in the radio room
still trying to get through.

325
00:58:44,168 --> 00:58:45,252
Everyone else is in the rec room.

326
00:58:46,987 --> 00:58:48,348
You go on. I'll be in in a minute.

327
00:59:12,706 --> 00:59:13,069
Blair?

328
00:59:15,825 --> 00:59:16,213
Blair?

329
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:51,825
TAPE PLAYER SLOWLY BITES THE DUST

330
01:00:19,438 --> 01:00:21,525
- He's got a gun. Get back.
- Anybody interferes, I'll kill them!

331
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:31,204
He smashed up some of the chopper
pretty good.

332
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:32,754
Nobody talk to nobody!

333
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:34,919
Childs, go see if he got to the tractor.

334
01:00:35,985 --> 01:00:36,460
Okay.

335
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:39,562
Nobody gets in and out of here. Nobody.

336
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:49,769
You guys think I'm crazy. Well, that's fine.

337
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:53,862
Most of you don't know what's going on
around here.

338
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:58,039
Well, I'm damn well sure some of you do.

339
01:00:59,153 --> 01:00:59,692
Christ.

340
01:01:03,638 --> 01:01:07,284
He got most of the chopper and the tractor,
and he's killed the rest of the dogs.

341
01:01:10,858 --> 01:01:12,300
Garry, wait a minute, wait a minute.

342
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:18,018
Now, Childs, go around to
the map room door. Talk to him.

343
01:01:19,003 --> 01:01:19,742
Okay.

344
01:01:20,398 --> 01:01:22,486
Norris, get a table from the lab.

345
01:01:25,535 --> 01:01:28,319
You think that thing
wanted to be an animal?

346
01:01:29,376 --> 01:01:32,324
No dogs make it a thousand miles
through the cold.

347
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:37,671
Nah, you don't understand!

348
01:01:38,648 --> 01:01:40,583
That thing wanted to be us!

349
01:01:41,826 --> 01:01:43,291
If the cell gets out

350
01:01:43,895 --> 01:01:46,439
it could imitate everything
on the face of the earth

351
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,738
- and it's not gonna stop!
- Okay, Blair.

352
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:52,105
Come on, man,
you don't wanna hurt anybody.

353
01:01:53,383 --> 01:01:54,603
I'LL KEEL YEW

354
01:02:21,045 --> 01:02:22,102
Good shot, MacReady.

355
01:02:22,132 --> 01:02:23,463
FUCHS FALLS INEXPLICABLY

356
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:34,147
What I do now is I take a
real brisk walk each morning.

357
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,465
Doctors are figuring out it's
better for you than jogging.

358
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:40,068
And I'll tell you something
else they're just figuring out.

359
01:02:40,733 --> 01:02:42,906
Oatmeal is even better for you than you thought.

360
01:02:43,546 --> 01:02:45,669
High in fiber, high in protein,

361
01:02:45,915 --> 01:02:49,245
low in calories, and no cholesterol whatsoever.

362
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:54,536
- Why am I in here?
- For your own protection, Blair.

363
01:03:09,815 --> 01:03:10,636
How you doing, old boy?

364
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,812
I don't know who to trust.

365
01:03:19,063 --> 01:03:20,716
I know what you mean, Blair.

366
01:03:22,862 --> 01:03:25,043
Trust's a tough thing to come by these days.

367
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:29,264
Tell you what.
Why don't you just trust in the Lord?

368
01:03:33,064 --> 01:03:36,272
- Watch Clark.
- What?

369
01:03:37,749 --> 01:03:40,352
I said, watch Clark.

370
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:43,448
And watch him close. Do you hear mwe?

371
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:53,052
Haha that was great - "Do you hear mwe?"

372
01:04:02,409 --> 01:04:04,133
And now the radio's gone.

373
01:04:04,555 --> 01:04:07,158
- And so are the choppers.
- We're completely cut off.

374
01:04:07,188 --> 01:04:10,920
All we can do now is hole up
'til spring, wait for the rescue team.

375
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,256
No, we don't wait.

376
01:04:13,488 --> 01:04:15,505
Somebody in this camp
ain't what he appears to be.

377
01:04:15,535 --> 01:04:18,842
Right now that may be one or two of us.
By spring, it could be all of us.

378
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:20,929
So how do we know who's human?

379
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,347
If I was an imitation, a perfect imitation,

380
01:04:26,348 --> 01:04:27,835
how would you know if it was really me?

381
01:04:30,192 --> 01:04:32,378
JEOPARDY THINKING MUSIC

382
01:04:44,057 --> 01:04:45,429
Is there some kind of test, Doc?

383
01:04:45,921 --> 01:04:50,108
Well, yeah, possibly.
I've been thinking about a blood serum test.

384
01:04:50,413 --> 01:04:50,864
What's that?

385
01:04:51,907 --> 01:04:56,867
We could take a sample of each person's
blood, we could mix it with uncontaminated blood.

386
01:04:57,212 --> 01:04:59,886
I suppose if there's a reaction,
we'd know who isn't human.

387
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:03,323
- We've got whole blood in storage.
- Start working on it.

388
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:05,340
Keep an eye on Clark.

389
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:07,744
He was close to that dog.

390
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:10,964
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

391
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:20,153
Mac, we need Blair's help.
He's the only one who knows what this organism...

392
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:21,696
He's too far gone, Fuchs.

393
01:05:21,726 --> 01:05:24,850
But get the rest of his notebooks.
Start going through them.

394
01:05:37,715 --> 01:05:40,002
Garry! Hey, you guys, come here!

395
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,437
- What?
- Somebody got to the blood.

396
01:05:45,467 --> 01:05:45,765
What?

397
01:05:47,454 --> 01:05:48,966
- Where's Clark?
- Right here.

398
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:53,164
- Wait a minute. Was this broken into?
- The lock is undamaged.

399
01:05:54,067 --> 01:05:56,248
Somebody opened it, closed it,
then locked it.

400
01:05:56,278 --> 01:05:56,811
Great.

401
01:05:57,022 --> 01:05:58,581
Who's got access to it?

402
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:05,031
I guess I'm the only one.

403
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,575
And I got the only key.

404
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:15,634
- Would that test have worked, Doc?
- Oh I think so, yes.

405
01:06:15,664 --> 01:06:17,229
Somebody else
sure as hell thought so.

406
01:06:17,663 --> 01:06:20,369
Well, who else could've used that key?

407
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:23,995
Nobody! I just give it to Copper
whenever he needs it.

408
01:06:25,153 --> 01:06:26,631
Could anybody have gotten it from you,
Doc?

409
01:06:27,346 --> 01:06:29,691
I don't see how. As soon as I'm finished,
I return it right away.

410
01:06:33,209 --> 01:06:33,830
Great.

411
01:06:36,821 --> 01:06:37,841
You got the keys?

412
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:40,678
Get them from Garry.
I wanna get some stuff out of here.

413
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,427
I suppose somebody could have
lifted it off me...

414
01:06:46,457 --> 01:06:47,442
Oh, come on!

415
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:49,529
That key ring of yours
is always hooked to your belt.

416
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:51,835
ALL ARGUING

417
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:54,831
Windows! Windows!

418
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,645
MUSIC: "Run For Your Life"
by The Beatles

419
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,180
Put that down!

420
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:13,370
- No.
- I'll put this right through your head.

421
01:07:15,628 --> 01:07:16,989
You guys gonna listen to Garry?

422
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:20,495
You gonna let him give the orders?
I mean he could be one of those things!

423
01:07:20,525 --> 01:07:21,021
Windows.

424
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,506
Wait a minute. Just take it easy.
Put the gun down.

425
01:07:26,629 --> 01:07:28,677
Put it down.
Garry you don't want to hurt anybody.

426
01:07:28,707 --> 01:07:29,147
Right.

427
01:07:30,363 --> 01:07:30,868
On the floor.

428
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:47,592
It's on the floor.

429
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:56,282
I don't know about Copper,

430
01:07:58,245 --> 01:08:00,266
but I give you my word,
I did not go near that blood.

431
01:08:09,308 --> 01:08:11,414
But I guess you'll all feel a little easier

432
01:08:14,041 --> 01:08:15,715
if somebody else was in charge.

433
01:08:17,837 --> 01:08:20,016
Norris, I can't see anybody objecting to you.

434
01:08:29,412 --> 01:08:31,135
I'm sorry fellas, but I'm not up to it.

435
01:08:32,097 --> 01:08:34,478
- I'll take it.
- Like hell you will.

436
01:08:35,185 --> 01:08:37,754
It should be somebody
a little more even-tempered, Childs.

437
01:08:49,178 --> 01:08:49,914
All right.

438
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:14,934
I know I'm human.

439
01:09:19,003 --> 01:09:22,034
And if you were all these things,
then you'd just attack me right now.

440
01:09:22,423 --> 01:09:24,155
So some of you are still human.

441
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:29,263
This thing doesn't want to show itself.
It wants to hide inside an imitation.

442
01:09:31,745 --> 01:09:32,992
It'll fight if it has to.

443
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,280
But it's vulnerable out in the open.

444
01:09:37,432 --> 01:09:38,620
If it takes us over,

445
01:09:41,026 --> 01:09:42,180
then it has no more enemies,

446
01:09:44,202 --> 01:09:45,255
nobody left to kill it.

447
01:09:47,275 --> 01:09:48,199
And then it's won.

448
01:09:52,486 --> 01:09:54,953
There's a storm hitting us in six hours.

449
01:09:55,635 --> 01:09:57,278
We're gonna find out who's who.

450
01:09:58,492 --> 01:10:02,128
All right, Doc, Garry and Clark,
move over there away from the others.

451
01:10:14,512 --> 01:10:16,994
Norris, you and Childs
shoot them up with morphine.

452
01:10:17,024 --> 01:10:18,554
Tie them down in the rec room
and watch them.

453
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:19,957
Fuchs, you start working
on a new test.

454
01:10:19,987 --> 01:10:22,560
- I need Doc's help.
- Yeah, you don't wanna drug me.

455
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:24,917
Mac, I'm not a prisoner!

456
01:10:47,181 --> 01:10:49,346
Let me do it.
You're gonna break the needle in my arm.

457
01:10:49,376 --> 01:10:52,174
No, Doc, he's doing a real fine job.

458
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:03,356
I'm gonna hide this tape when I'm finished.

459
01:11:04,617 --> 01:11:07,388
If none of us make it,
at least there'll be some kind of record.

460
01:11:09,034 --> 01:11:11,400
Storm's been hitting us hard now
for 48 hours.

461
01:11:13,219 --> 01:11:14,475
We still have nothing to go on.

462
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:31,077
One other thing,
I think it rips through your clothes

463
01:11:31,107 --> 01:11:32,289
when it takes you over.

464
01:11:34,082 --> 01:11:37,473
Windows found some shredded long johns,
but the name tag was missing.

465
01:11:39,306 --> 01:11:40,475
They could be anybody's.

466
01:11:42,785 --> 01:11:43,391
Nobody...

467
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:48,182
Nobody trusts anybody now.

468
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:51,761
And we're all very tired.

469
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:02,766
<i>♪ Love me tender, love me... ♪</i>

470
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:07,751
<i>Nobody trusts
anybody now.</i>

471
01:12:12,505 --> 01:12:13,847
There's nothing else I can do.

472
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:15,838
Just wait.

473
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:23,716
R.J. MacReady, helicopter pilot,
U.S. Outpost number 31.

474
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:11,832
You come up with anything yet?

475
01:13:13,043 --> 01:13:14,040
One or two ideas.

476
01:13:18,758 --> 01:13:20,402
But, MacReady, I've been thinking.

477
01:13:21,052 --> 01:13:24,515
If a small particle of this thing
is enough to take over an entire organism,

478
01:13:25,121 --> 01:13:26,939
then everyone should prepare
their own meals.

479
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,455
And I suggest we only eat out of cans.

480
01:13:30,992 --> 01:13:31,670
All right.

481
01:14:44,907 --> 01:14:46,335
Anybody see Fuchs?

482
01:14:49,893 --> 01:14:51,740
Somebody blew out a fuse in the lab.

483
01:14:52,058 --> 01:14:54,843
Lights were out for an hour.
Anyone of us could've gotten to him.

484
01:14:55,608 --> 01:14:57,224
All right, we gotta find him.

485
01:14:57,254 --> 01:14:59,952
Nauls, why don't you come with me
and we'll look outside.

486
01:15:00,573 --> 01:15:02,708
Palmer, you and Windows check the inside.

487
01:15:03,238 --> 01:15:04,286
I ain't going with Windows.

488
01:15:06,314 --> 01:15:09,263
I ain't going with him. I'll go with Childs.

489
01:15:09,293 --> 01:15:11,919
- Hey, fuck you, Palmer!
- I ain't going with you!

490
01:15:11,949 --> 01:15:14,502
- Who says I want you going with me?
- Cut the bullshit!

491
01:15:18,266 --> 01:15:20,388
Windows, you come with us.
Norris, you stay here.

492
01:15:20,418 --> 01:15:24,096
Any of them move, you fry them.
You hear anything, you cut loose on the sirens.

493
01:15:24,358 --> 01:15:26,624
We all meet back here
in 20 minutes regardless.

494
01:15:28,374 --> 01:15:31,996
And everybody watch whoever
you're with. Real close.

495
01:15:55,053 --> 01:15:55,597
Hey, Blair.

496
01:15:58,587 --> 01:15:59,932
Blair, have you seen Fuchs?

497
01:16:01,126 --> 01:16:01,535
You know,

498
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:05,352
a lot of cold cereals come
with prizes in their boxes.

499
01:16:05,874 --> 01:16:08,481
Plastic toys, paper gizmos, stuff like that...

500
01:16:09,379 --> 01:16:10,876
Quaker Oats doesn't come with prizes.

501
01:16:11,912 --> 01:16:15,044
But there's something in this
box that I think is really worth prizing.

502
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:16,026
Oats!

503
01:16:16,056 --> 01:16:20,213
Pure 100% natural whole grain oats.

504
01:16:20,382 --> 01:16:22,947
- Have you come across Fuchs?
- It ain't Fuchs.

505
01:16:26,684 --> 01:16:27,435
It ain't Fuchs.

506
01:16:29,064 --> 01:16:29,468
Now.

507
01:16:30,276 --> 01:16:33,931
One of the things I've learned to do is uh

508
01:16:33,961 --> 01:16:35,489
laugh at myself.

509
01:16:36,023 --> 01:16:36,918
Kinda loosen up.

510
01:16:37,942 --> 01:16:39,602
Kinda relax about the whole thing.

511
01:16:40,344 --> 01:16:44,697
You know having type 2 adult onset diabeetus
is not the worst thing in the world.

512
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:45,756
We'll see.

513
01:16:47,834 --> 01:16:49,868
Hey wait a minute, wait a minute, man.

514
01:16:51,413 --> 01:16:53,788
I wanna come back inside,
don't you understand?

515
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:58,724
I'm all right. I'm much better
and I won't harm anybody.

516
01:16:59,186 --> 01:17:01,712
You gotta let me come back inside.

517
01:17:08,651 --> 01:17:08,998
Hold it!

518
01:17:24,829 --> 01:17:25,753
Is it Fuchs?

519
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:34,499
Yeah.

520
01:17:36,256 --> 01:17:37,468
Why would it burn him?

521
01:17:38,839 --> 01:17:41,105
Flare. Maybe he tried to burn it.

522
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:48,091
Maybe he burned himself
before it could get to him.

523
01:17:55,609 --> 01:17:58,538
Great! Now what are we gonna do?

524
01:18:00,313 --> 01:18:02,622
You go inside.
Tell the others we found Fuchs.

525
01:18:03,158 --> 01:18:04,731
We'll be in as soon as we can.

526
01:18:05,482 --> 01:18:07,474
- Where are we going?
- Up to my shack.

527
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,090
What the hell for?

528
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,457
'Cause when I left yesterday,
I turned the lights off.

529
01:18:35,967 --> 01:18:37,136
How long have they been out there?

530
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:38,694
Forty, 45 minutes.

531
01:18:40,599 --> 01:18:42,114
We better start closing off
the outside doors.

532
01:19:31,262 --> 01:19:33,541
Hey! All of you, come here!

533
01:19:49,548 --> 01:19:53,959
Open up! Open up it's Nauls! Open up!
Open up!

534
01:19:56,216 --> 01:19:56,981
Close that door.

535
01:20:00,531 --> 01:20:01,180
Where's MacReady?

536
01:20:02,922 --> 01:20:04,875
I cut him loose of the line up by his shack.

537
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:06,145
- Cut him loose?
- Yeah.

538
01:20:06,864 --> 01:20:10,480
We were up checking around his place,
I found this.

539
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:15,744
Look. It was stashed in his oil furnace.

540
01:20:16,307 --> 01:20:18,674
Wind must've dislodged it,
but I don't think he saw me find it.

541
01:20:19,913 --> 01:20:23,128
I made sure I got ahead of him
on the towline on the way back.

542
01:20:24,156 --> 01:20:24,820
I cut him loose.

543
01:20:25,426 --> 01:20:27,547
- MacReady?
- He's one of them.

544
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:30,051
- When do you think it got to him?
- I don't know.

545
01:20:30,224 --> 01:20:32,317
It could've been anytime, anywhere.

546
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,097
If it did get to him.

547
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:36,237
Look, Childs, come on.

548
01:20:36,267 --> 01:20:38,424
- When the lights went out.
- That would've been the perfect time.

549
01:20:38,530 --> 01:20:41,539
Right. You said guys were missing.
And Windows, where were you?

550
01:20:41,569 --> 01:20:42,617
Hey Palmer I told you to shut up!

551
01:20:42,647 --> 01:20:44,725
Where were you when the lights went out?

552
01:20:44,755 --> 01:20:47,640
This is just what it wants!
To pit us against each other.

553
01:20:55,337 --> 01:20:56,650
- Let's open it.
- Hell no!

554
01:20:57,223 --> 01:20:58,695
You think he's changed
into one of those things?

555
01:20:58,725 --> 01:20:59,806
He's had plenty of time.

556
01:20:59,836 --> 01:21:02,130
Nothing human could've made it back
here in this weather without a guide line.

557
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,912
- Let's open it now.
- Why are you so damn anxious to let him in here?

558
01:21:04,942 --> 01:21:05,793
Because it's so close.

559
01:21:05,823 --> 01:21:09,786
- May be our best chance to blow it away.
- No! Just let him freeze to death outside.

560
01:21:09,974 --> 01:21:12,341
Childs, what if we're wrong about him?

561
01:21:12,802 --> 01:21:14,058
Well, then, we're wrong!

562
01:21:15,835 --> 01:21:16,846
The supply window!

563
01:21:18,087 --> 01:21:21,507
All right, all right, we got no choice now!

564
01:21:25,116 --> 01:21:26,934
Damn it! He's got the keys!

565
01:21:27,188 --> 01:21:29,373
What's going on?
The towline snapped.

566
01:21:29,403 --> 01:21:32,078
Bullshit, Childs.
He's got to know damn well I cut it!

567
01:21:35,728 --> 01:21:37,056
You're a dead man, MacReady!

568
01:21:39,485 --> 01:21:40,957
Or a dead whatever the hell you are!

569
01:21:51,737 --> 01:21:53,555
Anyone messes with me
and the whole camp goes.

570
01:21:55,979 --> 01:21:57,192
Come on, Childs, burn me.

571
01:21:59,616 --> 01:22:01,651
Put those torches on the floor and back off.

572
01:22:10,352 --> 01:22:12,775
Back off. Way off.

573
01:22:23,078 --> 01:22:25,676
- You asshole.
- You'd have done the same thing.

574
01:22:25,706 --> 01:22:26,888
Don't argue with him.

575
01:22:29,182 --> 01:22:29,961
Where's the rest?

576
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:36,327
Come on, man, I mean it!

577
01:22:37,032 --> 01:22:38,580
It's cool, MacReady, come on.

578
01:22:38,984 --> 01:22:40,701
Yeah. Yeah, man, just relax.

579
01:22:42,316 --> 01:22:45,089
Anybody touches me... and we go.

580
01:22:58,334 --> 01:23:00,816
- He's not breathing!
- Go untie the doc.

581
01:23:03,636 --> 01:23:05,714
Get him in here. And bring the others.

582
01:23:09,654 --> 01:23:11,112
From now on, nobody gets out of my sight.

583
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:28,209
So, you sweethearts were about to have
a little lynching party, huh?

584
01:23:30,027 --> 01:23:33,763
I might just have to put an end to you
on general principles, Nauls.

585
01:23:33,793 --> 01:23:36,777
Did it ever occur to the jury that anybody
could've gotten some of my clothes

586
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:39,854
- and stuck them up the furnace?
- We ain't buying that.

587
01:23:40,107 --> 01:23:44,156
Quit that bickering over there!
Windows, wheel that defibrillator over here.

588
01:23:45,138 --> 01:23:46,062
Give me those paddles!

589
01:23:47,216 --> 01:23:49,077
You're gonna have to
sleep sometime, MacReady.

590
01:23:49,655 --> 01:23:51,560
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs.

591
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:57,736
If anyone tries to wake me...

592
01:24:01,031 --> 01:24:01,334
Clear!

593
01:24:10,057 --> 01:24:11,024
- Clear!
- Clear.

599
01:25:22,559 --> 01:25:23,006
All right, go!

01:25:45,049 --> 01:25:47,214

- What do you got in mind, MacReady?
- A little test.

605
01:26:38,225 --> 01:26:42,202
And, Windows, you and Palmer,
tie everybody down real tight.

606
01:26:42,392 --> 01:26:43,991
- What for?
- For your health.

607
01:26:44,021 --> 01:26:46,181
C'mon let's rush him!
He's not gonna blow us all up!

608
01:26:50,677 --> 01:26:52,348
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

609
01:26:53,717 --> 01:26:55,273
Let's do what Mac says.

610
01:26:57,521 --> 01:27:00,302
I mean,
he wasted Norris pretty quick, didn't he?

611
01:27:00,398 --> 01:27:01,368
That's close enough, Clark.

612
01:27:02,244 --> 01:27:03,212
He ain't tying me up.

613
01:27:04,624 --> 01:27:06,091
Then I'll have to kill you, Childs.

614
01:27:07,201 --> 01:27:08,094
Then kill me.

615
01:27:17,962 --> 01:27:18,927
I mean it.

616
01:27:26,247 --> 01:27:27,356
I guess you do.

617
01:27:47,491 --> 01:27:48,827
This is bullshit, Mac!

618
01:27:48,857 --> 01:27:51,095
- Finish it, Palmer.
- They're dead, Mac!

619
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:58,258
- Windows?
- Yo?

620
01:28:00,204 --> 01:28:02,149
You tie up Palmer over here.

621
01:28:06,428 --> 01:28:08,633
We're gonna draw
a little bit of everybody's blood

622
01:28:12,264 --> 01:28:14,209
'cuz we're gonna find out
who's the thing.

623
01:28:16,413 --> 01:28:19,266
Watching Norris in there
gave me the idea that

624
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,465
maybe every part of him was a whole.

625
01:28:24,453 --> 01:28:26,701
Every little piece was an individual animal

626
01:28:28,084 --> 01:28:30,202
with a built-in desire to protect its own life.

627
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:35,173
You see, when a man bleeds,

628
01:28:37,652 --> 01:28:38,747
it's just tissue.

629
01:28:41,614 --> 01:28:44,136
The blood from one of you things
won't obey when it's attacked.

630
01:28:46,052 --> 01:28:47,017
It'll try and survive.

631
01:28:49,812 --> 01:28:51,585
Crawl away from a hot needle the same.

632
01:29:14,477 --> 01:29:15,025
Now you.

633
01:29:39,306 --> 01:29:40,012
That's good.

634
01:29:41,244 --> 01:29:42,815
All right, move back, over there.

635
01:29:41,244 --> 01:29:42,815


636
01:30:31,294 --> 01:30:32,159
I guess you're okay.

637
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:37,908
All right. Put that on and watch them.

638
01:30:47,993 --> 01:30:49,708
Now I'll show you what I already know.

639
01:30:55,478 --> 01:30:56,552
It's a crock of shit.

640
01:30:58,244 --> 01:30:59,930
Let's try the doc and Clark.

641
01:31:18,474 --> 01:31:19,079
Now Clark.

642
01:31:29,194 --> 01:31:30,448
Then Clark was human, huh?

643
01:31:32,393 --> 01:31:33,906
Which makes you a murderer, don't it?

644
01:31:35,246 --> 01:31:36,154
Palmer now.

645
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:46,096
This is pure nonsense.
It doesn't prove a thing.

646
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,819
I thought you'd feel that way, Garry.

647
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:50,966
You were the only one that could've
got to that blood.

648
01:31:51,659 --> 01:31:52,568
We'll do you last.

01:32:12,188 --> 01:32:14,156
Do not want!
Mac Lady!

657
01:32:38,988 --> 01:32:40,358
It is so big!

658
01:32:42,977 --> 01:32:44,477
It is so big!

660
01:32:55,648 --> 01:32:56,686
He is very deep!

Mac Lady! Hurry the up!

662
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:08,839
Mac Lady!

663
01:33:10,074 --> 01:33:11,182
Blow him off!

664
01:33:38,801 --> 01:33:40,094
Finish off!

665
01:33:46,129 --> 01:33:49,259
Mac Lady! Coming again! Mac Lady!

666
01:33:50,316 --> 01:33:51,392
I feel far from good!

667
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:52,828
He is in my behind!

668
01:33:53,691 --> 01:33:54,499
Mac Lady!

669
01:33:56,071 --> 01:33:58,840
Mac Lady the disgusting thing will erect!

670
01:33:59,023 --> 01:34:01,587
Fast! Burn it for God! Fast!

671
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:04,540
Radiate!

672
01:34:05,632 --> 01:34:06,136
Mac Lady!

673
01:34:38,084 --> 01:34:39,089
Voodoo me.

674
01:34:53,665 --> 01:34:59,117
Take mine out! Time to eject!
Cut my hell! You are at full cock now!

675
01:34:59,147 --> 01:35:02,255
Release now my manhood!
I have enough waiting!

676
01:35:20,991 --> 01:35:23,890
I know you sirs
You are worked on the very hard

677
01:35:25,015 --> 01:35:26,659

We're going out to give Blair the test.
If he tries to make it back here

682
01:35:59,017 --> 01:35:59,751
and we're not with him...

683
01:36:01,078 --> 01:36:01,568
Burn him.

684
01:36:22,174 --> 01:36:23,588
Mac, the door's open!

685
01:36:39,103 --> 01:36:42,088
How'd he get out?
The door was bolted from the outside.

686
01:37:27,326 --> 01:37:27,830
Blair?

687
01:37:32,062 --> 01:37:36,043
Hey, Blair, you down there?
We got something for ya!

688
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:49,589
Blair's been busy out here
all by himself.

689
01:38:00,387 --> 01:38:01,052
What is it?

690
01:38:02,282 --> 01:38:03,089
Something he's been making.

691
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:04,906
It's a ship of some kind.

692
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:09,013
He stole the parts from the helicopter.

693

The smart S.O.B. put it together
piece by piece.

01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,272

Hey, you guys, come here. Come here.

698
01:39:37,003 --> 01:39:39,166
I think I saw Childs outside
the main entrance of the camp.

699
01:39:40,738 --> 01:39:42,916
- What's he doing outside?
- I don't know.

700
01:39:54,443 --> 01:39:55,150
Got a flare?

701
01:39:59,189 --> 01:40:00,948
He got back inside and blew the generator.

702
01:40:04,308 --> 01:40:06,371
In six hours,
it'll be a hundred below in here.

703
01:40:06,933 --> 01:40:07,942
Well, that's suicide!

704
01:40:09,695 --> 01:40:12,969
Not for that thing. It wants to freeze now.

705
01:40:14,498 --> 01:40:15,551
It's got no way out of here.

706
01:40:15,581 --> 01:40:18,032
It just wants to go to sleep in the cold
until the rescue team finds it.

707
01:40:20,916 --> 01:40:22,892
What can we do? What can we do?

708
01:40:24,854 --> 01:40:27,479
Whether we make it or not,
we can't let that thing freeze again.

709
01:40:30,047 --> 01:40:32,051
Maybe we'll just warm things up
a little around here.

710
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:39,606
We're not getting out of here alive.

711
01:40:42,654 --> 01:40:43,606
But neither is that thing.

How's it coming in there?

726
01:46:27,762 --> 01:46:29,172
I said, how's it...

01:48:43,656 --> 01:48:45,257
Yeah, fuck you, too!

01:48:46,988 --> 01:48:48,257
Fuck you too.

729
01:50:16,308 --> 01:50:17,174
You the only one who made it?

730
01:50:19,462 --> 01:50:20,414
Not the only one.

731
01:50:23,370 --> 01:50:24,063
Did you kill it?

732
01:50:26,292 --> 01:50:27,546
Where were you, Childs?

733
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:30,821
Thought I saw Blair.

734
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:36,604
I went out after him
and got lost in the storm.

735
01:50:47,479 --> 01:50:49,383
Fire's got the temperature up
all over the camp.

736
01:50:52,801 --> 01:50:53,854
Won't last long, though.

737
01:50:55,515 --> 01:50:56,276
Neither will we.

738
01:50:59,337 --> 01:51:00,187
How will we make it?

739
01:51:03,317 --> 01:51:04,081
Maybe we shouldn't.

If we've got any surprises for each other,

742
01:51:16,499 --> 01:51:18,749
I don't think we're in much shape
to do anything about it.

743
01:51:23,851 --> 01:51:27,529
Well... What do we do?

744
01:51:29,145 --> 01:51:30,264
Why don't we just...

745
01:51:32,673 --> 01:51:33,928
wait here for a little while?

746
01:51:37,423 --> 01:51:38,500
