1
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,426
Where are you going?

2
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,137
Help me!

3
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,805
Over here!

4
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,797
Go!

5
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,174
Go!

6
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,386
That was a B-29, bub.
There's no outrunning what's coming.

7
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,472
Yashida!

8
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,021
You're better off down here.

9
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,567
I'd hurry if I were you.

10
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:00,883
Run. Now!

11
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,813
Stay down!

12
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,653
No, wait! No, no. Wait.

13
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,159
No. It's not safe.

14
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,998
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Wake up.

15
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,168
Where were you?

16
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,214
Nagasaki.

17
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,550
That far back?

18
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,518
You're here.

19
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,811
Of course.

20
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,729
Can you stay?

21
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,482
You know I can't.

22
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,652
Jean, I'm so sorry.

23
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,070
I know.

24
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,865
I'll never hurt you or anyone
ever again.

25
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,367
I made a vow.

26
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,911
A solemn vow?

27
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,247
You're making fun of me.

28
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,334
It's too late.

29
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,467
No! No, Jean!

30
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,052
No, no, no! Please!

31
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,303
You can't hide.

32
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,471
No, no, no! Please!

33
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,806
You can't hide!

34
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,516
No, Jean! No!

35
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,226
No.

36
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,471
Whack all of that on store credit.
Thanks, honey.

37
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,477
- Got the arrows?
- Yeah.

38
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,145
Remember the arrows?

39
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,148
Yeah, yeah, Eddie, we got them!

40
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,613
Yeah!

41
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,494
What are you doing?

42
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,204
Man, you almost blew his foot off!

43
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,331
You're not a hunter, are you?

44
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,959
Not anymore.

45
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,353
What the hell?

46
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,789
Don't make me do this.

47
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,667
It must have been
damn near 12 feet tall.

48
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,295
We didn't hear
nothing except twigs.

49
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,047
Then it just came upon us.

50
00:11:56,006 --> 00:12:00,219
It got Riley, just gutted him.
It got Eddie.

51
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,849
Ripped through the tent, knocked
over the snowcat like it was a toy.

52
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,768
You the one was attacked
by the grizzly?

53
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,606
I'm the one that survived.

54
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,408
I'd like to buy this man a drink.

55
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,203
What's your name, mister?

56
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,965
It's Logan.

57
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,262
And that's a poison broadhead,
which, last I heard, was illegal.

58
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,485
Go ahead,
ask me where I found it.

59
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,412
Ask me.

60
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,164
Where did you find it?

61
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,333
Well,
funny you should ask.

62
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,668
I pulled it out of
the back of a grizzly.

63
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,339
Whoever shot it, didn't
have the wind or the balls

64
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,840
to track the animal properly...

65
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,008
and put it out of its misery.

66
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,348
Instead of dropping a lethal
dose of the poison...

67
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,435
it bled into the bear, made him
crazy, killed five people.

68
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,270
I don't know what
you're talking about.

69
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,147
Because I don't dip
my arrows in anything.

70
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,359
In that case, you got
nothing to worry about.

71
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,449
Damn.

72
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,124
That hurt.

73
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,044
Sorry, Jean.

74
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,507
I wouldn't bother with them.

75
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,802
Most of them will die soon
anyway, without your help.

76
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,848
Three of them, a week from
now in the same truck.

77
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,493
This sword is
hundreds of years old...

78
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,038
and was named Danzan by the
first samurai who used it.

79
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,041
Danzan means "separator"
in Japanese.

80
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:42,298
The ideal weapon for separating
head and limb from body.

81
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,933
Whoa!

82
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,060
Like so.

83
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,440
I'm parked in back.

84
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,575
Get in.

85
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,589
Sorry, it's a rental.

86
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,509
Who are you?

87
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,346
Me? I'm Yukio.

88
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,931
And?

89
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,642
I've been trying to find
you for over a year.

90
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,352
Why?

91
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,520
To give you that.

92
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,981
My employer
wanted you to have it.

93
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,984
Who's your employer?

94
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,195
Master Yashida.

95
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,297
He said it belongs to you, and
that he's paying all debts.

96
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,967
Master Yashida is dying.

97
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,971
He wants to say thank you for saving
his life all those years ago.

98
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,556
He knows that you are a...

99
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,809
busy man.

100
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,479
But he very much wants to
say his goodbye in person.

101
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,564
All right, where is he?

102
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,983
Tokyo.

103
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,235
Wait...
I'm not going to Japan.

104
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,904
It would be dishonorable for
you to refuse his request.

105
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:33,158
Well, apologize to Mr. Yashida,
I'm not going to Tokyo.

106
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,868
All right?
I've got things to do.

107
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,412
Do not apologize.

108
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,081
It's been an honor just
to meet the Wolverine.

109
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,586
That's not who I am
anymore, you understand?

110
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,589
Interesting.

111
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,552
Why did you go into that bar,
if not to seek justice?

112
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,720
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

113
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,096
- No!
- I think you know.

114
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,265
- Pull over.
- You are a soldier.

115
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,683
No, I'm not. Pull over.

116
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,892
You are a soldier.

117
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,686
Pull over, now!

118
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,187
Now.

119
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,612
You are a soldier, and you
seek what all soldiers do.

120
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,947
And what's that?

121
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,616
An honorable death.

122
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,993
An end to your pain.

123
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,288
Who says I'm in pain?

124
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:24,626
A man who has nightmares every
night of his life is in pain.

125
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,520
One day.

126
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,691
I say goodbye to Mr. Yashida
and I come right back.

127
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,486
Okay.

128
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,453
Fifteen hours.
Depending on the wind.

129
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,705
Fifteen hours?

130
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,208
You don't like to fly?

131
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,293
I love it.

132
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,693
We are almost there.

133
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,613
So, you can see the future?

134
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,658
I can read a map.

135
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,411
You said you knew the future
of those assholes in the bar.

136
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,248
I know
they are going to die.

137
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,251
We are all going to die.

138
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,921
You said they would die in
the same truck, in a week.

139
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,590
If you're right,
that's quite a talent.

140
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,929
We don't all have claws.

141
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,935
So, do I die on this plane?

142
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,604
No.

143
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,065
Not on this plane.

144
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,097
Don't let the lights fool you.

145
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,932
These are dark days
in Japan.

146
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,783
A lot of guns.

147
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,452
There have been attacks.

148
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,330
Attempted kidnappings.
Attempted assassinations.

149
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,831
By who?

150
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,500
The Japanese mob, the Yakuza.

151
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,795
They've grown strong
as the government has grown weak.

152
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,634
Hip replacement.

153
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,870
Hey.

154
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,331
This way.

155
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,708
Who's that?

156
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,839
Shingen, Master Yashida's son.

157
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,427
He's good.

158
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,931
He's all right.

159
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,605
So, what happened
to the badass in boots?

160
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,941
Master Yashida is traditional.

161
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,069
One eye on the past
and the other on the future.

162
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,087
That's Mariko, his granddaughter.

163
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,482
Mariko.

164
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,485
What's wrong with you?

165
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,164
You haven't answered my emails.

166
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,458
I can't tell you now.

167
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,169
Yes, you can.

168
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,633
Who is the caveman?

169
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,928
The man Grandfather wanted me to find.

170
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,265
You can't bring him in like that.

171
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,986
Shizu and Saki
are going to disinfect you.

172
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:45,864
Give you a shave.

173
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,532
Like hell they are.

174
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,534
Get in the tub.

175
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,161
Whoa.

176
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,455
Get in the tub.

177
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,499
Really?

178
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,504
All right.

179
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,968
Okay. Okay.

180
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,513
All right, all right, all right.
I can do that bit.

181
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,650
What?

182
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,903
What?

183
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,072
You look nice.

184
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,699
I feel violated.

185
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,537
Prepare two more suppressors
for Master Yashida.

186
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,580
And check his blood pressure.

187
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,258
Yashida-sama.

188
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,390
Oh...

189
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,851
Kuzuri.

190
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,270
You look the same.

191
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,772
But, then,
that is no surprise.

192
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,525
Five minutes, no more.

193
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:11,199
Oh, forget the etiquette.
I'm past such precautions.

194
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,793
For many years I have wanted to
thank you for saving my life.

195
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,296
Yeah, well...

196
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,174
You were kind to me.

197
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,051
And you were kind
to many people.

198
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,596
I saw that even
from that well.

199
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,785
The painting is from
the village of my birth.

200
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:00,582
It depicts the bravery and
skill of the Black Clan.

201
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,210
Ninja warriors.

202
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,421
They served my family
for seven centuries.

203
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:11,760
I didn't send for you
only to thank you, Logan.

204
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,388
I wanted to repay you.

205
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,102
To offer you something
no one else can.

206
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,398
A gift to equal
the life you gave to me.

207
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,275
I don't need anything.

208
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,902
Not a thing.

209
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,280
Eternity can be a curse.

210
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,159
It hasn't been easy for you,
living without time.

211
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,079
The losses you
have had to suffer.

212
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,499
A man can run out
of things to live for.

213
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,918
Lose his purpose.

214
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,795
Become a ronin.

215
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,299
A samurai without a master.

216
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,431
I can end your eternity.

217
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,517
Make you mortal.

218
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:08,483
What they did to me,
what I am, can't be undone.

219
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,611
Yashida Industries
can do anything.

220
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,783
We have reason to believe your
ability to heal can be passed.

221
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,951
Passed?

222
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,661
From you to another.

223
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,293
You have struggled
long enough, Logan.

224
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,878
I'm confused.

225
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:32,674
I came here to say goodbye
to a man I once knew.

226
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,551
I am the same man.

227
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,220
I was not ready to die then.

228
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,889
I am not ready to die now.

229
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,891
But you are...

230
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,894
aren't you?

231
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,149
Are you offering to kill me?
No.

232
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,192
Not right away.

233
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,030
You can live a long
and ordinary life.

234
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,241
Fall in love,
have a family...

235
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,327
grow old.

236
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:05,665
And one day,
die an ordinary death.

237
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,504
It can be done.

238
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:17,052
Yeah, look, nice to see you again.
Sorry you got sick.

239
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,263
Please, Logan-san.
I need you again.

240
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,849
I fear for my family.

241
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,518
I fear for everything
I have built.

242
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,895
- Enough.
- Please, Logan-san.

243
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,439
- You should leave.
- They're going to kill her.

244
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,273
Who?

245
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,734
Mariko,
my grand daughter.

246
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,738
She is my treasure.
She must be protected.

247
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,702
You don't want
what I've got.

248
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,997
Kuzuri!

249
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,958
- Kuzuri?
- He needs a sedative.

250
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,920
Breathe slowly and calm yourself.

251
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,340
- Please, father!
- Quiet! 

252
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,258
Wait, father.
Please, listen to me.

253
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,260
Not now, Mariko.

254
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,264
- Plese, listen to me, Dad.
- Stop bothering me!

255
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,850
- Please, listen to me.
- I have no time for this.

256
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,645
- You must hear what Grandfather told me.
- I told you, shut up!

257
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,148
You just don't care,
that's why grandfather...

258
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,634
Careful, careful.
It's slippery out here.

259
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,970
Let go.

260
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,849
You about done?

261
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,310
Let go of me.

262
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,497
Don't look so sad, Shingen.

263
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,417
I'm still dying.

264
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,471
There is no easy way to say this.

265
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:30,268
But then, it's never been
easy for us, has it?

266
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,563
I have tried, father.

267
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,149
You've done the best you can.

268
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,162
You have always been
my assumed successor.

269
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,499
So the past few years,
as a test,

270
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,542
I allowed you
more control.

271
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,086
It has been an honor.

272
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,381
And I now realize
that was a mistake.

273
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,053
You have brought this
company close to ruin.

274
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,847
You're not making sense, Father...

275
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:12,018
When I die, someone else will
take my place as chairman.

276
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:19,442
Father, I'm sorry if I
have disappointed you...

277
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,528
Let's not insult
one another.

278
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,990
You are not the man
to lead Yashida.

279
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,788
You cannot bring in
someone from the outside.

280
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,083
In that,
you are correct.

281
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,315
That will never happen.

282
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,541
He just wanted to say goodbye, huh?

283
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,675
You two grew up together.

284
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,510
Yes.

285
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,846
But you're not her sister.

286
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,348
No.

287
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,854
Master Yashida found me
on a trip to the South.

288
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,691
He brought Mariko to see a factory
he was building.

289
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,239
I was digging through the garbage
for something to eat.

290
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,910
So they just took you home with them?

291
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,581
It was always difficult for Mariko
to make friends.

292
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,134
I'll see to it the plane
is ready in the morning.

293
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,511
Sleep here.

294
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,230
Eternity
can be a curse...

295
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,399
Kuzuri.

296
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,945
You have no pain, Kuzuri?

297
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,154
How old are you?

298
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,581
He's dead.

299
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,279
Who's that?
With Mariko?

300
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,947
His name is Noburo Mori.

301
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,658
Minister of Justice, a rising star.

302
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,453
He's Marika's fiancé.

303
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,622
You need to bow.

304
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,046
Bow.

305
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,636
Lord Shingen,
this is Mr. Logan.

306
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,638
I know who he is.

307
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,973
Your father was a good man.

308
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,727
He would often say the same about you.

309
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,649
But then, he was always
fascinated with your kind.

310
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,863
Tell me, why do you think
he sent our little Yukio to fetch you?

311
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,325
To say goodbye.

312
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,162
And now you have.

313
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,374
Time for you to go back to your cave.

314
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,517
Anyone else you want me to meet?

315
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,198
That armor belonged
to Shiruba-Samurai...

316
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,659
the Silver Samurai.

317
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,246
It will stand watch
over the old man forever.

318
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,598
Logan?

319
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,189
Hey.
Something's not right.

320
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,442
Let go.

321
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,637
Logan!

322
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,933
Logan!

323
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,499
Logan!

324
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,745
Kuzuri.

325
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,332
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!

326
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,722
- Yukio!
- Mariko!

327
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,972
Mariko!

328
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,082
Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

329
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,253
Here, here! Here!

330
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,600
Move!

331
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,562
In here! Move!

332
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,198
Keep moving, keep moving.

333
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,492
Move!

334
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,170
You're bleeding. You need help.

335
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,838
Just keep moving.

336
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,849
Thank you for what you did back there.

337
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,559
- Those were Yakuza.
- I'm fine.

338
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,394
Why are they after you?

339
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,105
I'm fine. I can make my way from here.

340
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,901
You should go. Get yourself a doctor.

341
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,745
That's nice.

342
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,250
This is one of those
bullet trains, right?

343
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,293
I told you I don't need your help.

344
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,631
So what do they do, like,
300 miles an hour?

345
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,642
This cowardly attack was...

346
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,769
the work of Yakuza thugs.

347
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:48,023
A violent response to my efforts...

348
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,443
to crack down on organized crime.

349
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,365
They exited the North Gate.

350
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,493
She was with the stranger--

351
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,627
Your gaijin friend,
where is he?

352
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,297
Last I saw,
he was protecting your daughter.

353
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,342
You are a toy doll.

354
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,637
A companion for a child
who has outgrown you.

355
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,015
Keep that in mind.

356
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,529
So, where are we headed,
Mariko?

357
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,201
Where are we going?

358
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:47,583
I'm going to the end of the line.
My family has a home in the South.

359
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,376
That's stupid.

360
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,005
No offense, but they're gonna know
to look for you there.

361
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,174
Not this place.

362
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,509
- You want to be left alone.
- Yes.

363
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,594
- I understand.
- Do you?

364
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,346
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

365
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,555
Problem is, if I do that...

366
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,849
I don't think you're gonna live
to see the end of the day.

367
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:11,190
You can't pretend shit isn't happening
when it is, princess.

368
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:15,069
Unless you want to die. In that case,
you're playing this perfectly.

369
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,886
What the hell?

370
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,283
What the hell is happening?

371
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,828
What happened to you?

372
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,496
We get off here. Let's go.

373
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,541
Just listen to me, will you?
We need to find someplace safe.

374
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,502
I don't understand.
How do you know they were Yakuza?

375
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,087
They were the same guys from the temple.

376
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,589
How do you know they were after me?

377
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:06,008
Look, we need to find someplace safe.
We need to get off the streets.

378
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,051
- I don't understand.
- Shut up! Listen.

379
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,596
Do you know this place?
Where's downtown?

380
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,347
Straight ahead.

381
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,859
So, where's the nice part of town?

382
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,277
Another eight blocks that way.

383
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,529
Good. We're staying here.

384
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,531
Let's go.

385
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,538
This is a love hotel.

386
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,040
A what?

387
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,708
A love hotel.

388
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,712
For couples, understand?

389
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,214
Right.

390
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,216
Hey.

391
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,554
Two rooms.
Adjoining rooms, on the same ﬂoor.

392
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,057
Right next to each other. Very close.

393
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,601
Same ﬂoor. Same floor.

394
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,829
What did she say?

395
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,917
She has no rooms available
next to each other.

396
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:26,964
She's asking if we prefer
"the dungeon", "the nurse's office..."

397
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,425
or the "mission to Mars."

398
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,943
This'll do.

399
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,116
Liftoff! We have a liftoff!

400
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,451
Kind of homey, actually.

401
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,502
Where do you plan on sleeping?

402
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,006
I don't.

403
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,490
That's a lot of blood.

404
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,163
I thought you were done being the hero.

405
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,750
But these guys were...
trying to kill her.

406
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,504
Just let it go.

407
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,674
It's not hard to die.

408
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,345
Come to me.

409
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:06,581
This is Mieko from the hotel
and her grandson, Hitoshi.

410
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,333
Is he a doctor?

411
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,169
In a manner of speaking, yes.

412
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,755
He's a veterinarian...

413
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,508
student.

414
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,760
Large animal.

415
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,266
Thanks.

416
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:32,440
You may have cut him once or twice
while he was stitching you.

417
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,610
Okay, okay, okay.

418
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,537
Hey.

419
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,457
Thank you.

420
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,840
I never needed this before.

421
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,342
What? Help?

422
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,210
We get off here.

423
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,147
Where are we?

424
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,858
Just outside Nagasaki.

425
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,410
This way.

426
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,223
This is the guy from the
funeral, the archer.

427
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,518
He was your boyfriend.

428
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,812
That's Harada.

429
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,982
We were village champions that summer.

430
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:42,028
He with the bow and me with the knives.

431
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,245
Harada and I were
planning to get married.

432
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,038
What stopped you?

433
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,498
Grandfather.

434
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,334
He said we had to wait
until we were at least 15.

435
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,553
From the mountain,
from the sea.

436
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,401
Chopsticks upright are a bad omen.

437
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,404
It resembles incense
at a funeral.

438
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,410
Nothing is without meaning.

439
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,915
So, the other night at the house,
when you ran out in the rain...

440
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,251
what did that mean?

441
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,005
My grandfather was dying.

442
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,842
You knew he was gonna die.
He'd been sick for a long time.

443
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,511
It wasn't his death I feared.

444
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,972
So, what, then?

445
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,143
What did he tell you that night?

446
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,024
Mariko,
why did your father hit you?

447
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,610
I was trying to warn him.

448
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,445
About what?

449
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,282
What did your grandfather tell you?

450
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,621
He told me that...

451
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:21,169
in three days.
when they read his will...

452
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:27,801
I will become
the most powerful person in Japan.

453
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,389
He gave it all to me.

454
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,225
The company?

455
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,481
I didn't want it.

456
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,652
He knew that.

457
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,572
I don't understand why
he gave it to me.

458
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,367
It was all my father dreamed of.

459
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,370
Well, that's why.

460
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,001
What about this fiancé of yours?
Nostromo.

461
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,170
Noburo.

462
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,005
Does he know about this?

463
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,507
No.

464
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,677
Why are you marrying him?

465
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,096
He seems like kind of an asshole.

466
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,350
My father arranged it last year.

467
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,852
What?

468
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:22,230
It gives him a better access
to the political theater.

469
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,945
To disobey my father
would be to dishonor him.

470
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,244
I don't expect you to understand.

471
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,291
You're not Japanese.

472
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:51,551
Our island is long and thin.

473
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,095
Trains only run in two directions.

474
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,222
I assure you Lord Shingen...

475
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,266
my officers are making every effort--

476
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,268
Then they're idiots.

477
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,437
You've wasted enough of my time.

478
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,315
I have my father's affairs to attend to.

479
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,444
Get out and find her!

480
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,411
Tell me you have more promising news
from your contacts.

481
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,122
They open the will in three days.

482
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,416
We are running out of time.

483
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,920
Soon, I hope.

484
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,255
I'm sending men to the South.

485
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,424
That's where we found the bodies.

486
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,270
If the Yakuza got
into the funeral...

487
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,855
they had someone inside.

488
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,525
They'll never find me here.

489
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,361
You're not safe.

490
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,197
I'm coming down there.

491
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,782
They'll follow you.

492
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,450
Please.

493
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,119
Wait a few days.

494
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,621
Please. I'm fine.

495
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,498
Logan's here.

496
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,708
He's wounded, Mariko.

497
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:08,628
Someone's here.

498
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,462
Mariko?

499
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,380
I have to go.

500
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,714
Mariko?

501
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,637
A tree fell on the road.

502
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,974
The men could use some help.

503
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,841
Are you okay?

504
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,596
Tired.

505
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,848
Do you need something?

506
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,059
No.

507
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,278
This will help.

508
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,581
It's time.

509
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,460
What?

510
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,214
Please. Take it.

511
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:19,258
Thank you.

512
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,945
No.

513
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,115
Two hands.

514
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:46,411
Japanese sword
require two hands.

515
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,376
- Like that?
- That's it.

516
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,964
It's beautiful, Yashida.

517
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,093
But I can't take it.

518
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:03,886
Please.

519
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,264
Thank you.

520
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,855
Keep it safe.

521
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,651
Keep it safe for me.

522
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,823
Someday,
I'll come get it.

523
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,332
It's time.

524
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:23,716
I was here when it happened.

525
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,596
It's how I met your grandfather.

526
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,057
We hid in there.

527
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,101
I heard the stories.

528
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,399
My grandfather would say...

529
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:43,736
what happened here was proof that
everything in the world finds peace.

530
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,409
Eventually.

531
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:57,250
That man can recover from anything.

532
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,798
Maybe you, too.

533
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,931
You don't sleep very well.

534
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,100
You call out in the night.

535
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:21,983
Who's Jean?

536
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,667
We should go back. There's rain coming.

537
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,673
This isn't right.

538
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,565
You need this tied
like a proper samurai.

539
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:50,738
Your grandfather called
me a ronin.

540
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,533
A samurai without a master.

541
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,538
He said
I was destined to live forever...

542
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:03,084
with no reason to live.

543
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,590
Was he right?

544
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:12,218
Yes.

545
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,100
Still?

546
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,275
Hey.

547
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,819
What are you doing?

548
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,951
This isn't going to end well.

549
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,291
Everyone you love dies.

550
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,980
Kuzuri.

551
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:51,817
Do you know what that means?

552
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,324
An animal.

553
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:03,704
A fierce creature
with long claws and sharp teeth.

554
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,833
It fears nothing.

555
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:13,672
When I was a girl, I had nightmares.

556
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,717
I'd wake up and run to my parents.

557
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:20,387
My father would get angry.

558
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,895
"Go back to sleep. Face your fears."

559
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,857
My grandfather was different.

560
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:36,570
He told me stories about Kuzuri,
his friend.

561
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,533
Who he met at the bottom of a well.

562
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:47,206
He said the Kuzuri was magical
and saved his life.

563
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:54,880
He said Kuzuri would protect me, too,
as I slept in my bed.

564
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,599
Who's Jean?

565
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:14,775
Is she like you?

566
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,572
What happened to her?

567
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:22,783
She died.

568
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,250
I killed her.

569
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,800
Along with the Kuzuri.

570
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,509
Logan.

571
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,817
Mariko?

572
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,154
Logan!

573
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,323
Logan!

574
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:46,992
Mariko?

575
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,827
Mariko!

576
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,538
No! Logan!

577
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,504
No!

578
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:00,381
Logan!

579
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,049
No!

580
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:14,895
Mariko!

581
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,692
Logan!

582
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,528
No!

583
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:25,864
Logan!

584
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:28,701
Mariko!
Mariko!

585
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,369
Logan!

586
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:52,057
Where are they taking her?

587
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:53,892
Where are they taking her?

588
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:55,561
Where, you piece of shit?

589
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,065
I no talk, gaijin.

590
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,609
I never talk.

591
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:11,243
Who hired you?

592
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:24,131
Uh-oh.

593
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,101
Take me to Noburo.

594
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,771
- Logan...
- Take me to him.

595
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:40,939
I need to tell you something.

596
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:42,983
Do it. Now.

597
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:04,171
You wait in the car.

598
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:06,673
- Logan.
- What?

599
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,468
I saw you die.

600
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,136
What?

601
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,347
I saw you die.

602
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,808
When? Just now?

603
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,976
A while ago.

604
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:21,021
But it's not like
I get a complete picture.

605
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,399
More like looking through a keyhole.

606
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,236
But I'm always right.

607
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:31,490
All I can see
is one part of a person's life...

608
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,659
their death.

609
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:36,578
And I saw yours.

610
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:41,708
So, what did you see?

611
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:46,505
I see you on your back.
There's blood everywhere.

612
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:51,510
You're holding your own heart
in your hand.

613
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,597
It's not beating.

614
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,683
I don't have time for this shit.

615
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:01,895
When I was five,
I knew how my own parents would die.

616
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:07,693
Then I watched it happen
from the back seat.

617
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,864
Look at me.

618
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,703
A lot of people have tried to kill me,
and I'm still here.

619
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,788
Yeah...

620
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:22,458
but you're different now, aren't you?

621
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,127
They can hurt you.

622
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,296
They can kill you.

623
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,465
Just wait in the car.

624
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,143
I said, wait in the car.

625
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,311
You need backup.

626
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,396
You're not safe, not in your condition.

627
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:48,734
Just think of me as your bodyguard.

628
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,495
Sexy.

629
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:07,336
Come on!

630
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,504
I'm coming.

631
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:20,015
Okay, round four. Here we go.

632
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:34,613
Drink for you, my lady.

633
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:43,664
Get out.

634
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:51,004
Not you.

635
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,132
Call me old-fashioned...

636
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:57,135
but I thought being engaged meant you
were done with this kind of bullshit.

637
01:15:57,302 --> 01:16:00,013
I am the Minister of Justice. Do you
have any idea what I could do to you?

638
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,976
Really? You're gonna try and talk tough,
standing there in your red underwear?

639
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:05,519
You have ten words...

640
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:08,063
ten words...

641
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:12,568
to explain to me why you,
the Minister of Justice...

642
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:15,821
would want your fiancé
killed by the Yakuza.

643
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,364
And if I don't like
what you say,

644
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:18,824
you are going through that window.

645
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,743
You don't have the faintest idea
what's going on--

646
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:25,706
How many words was that?

647
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:26,540
Nine.

648
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,251
Nine. You have one word left.

649
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:32,963
Really?

650
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:36,550
Shingen. Shingen!

651
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:39,720
Keep going.

652
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,681
He tried to be a good son
and thought he'd be rewarded.

653
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:45,892
And then the old man
left everything to his granddaughter.

654
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:48,645
If Mariko got all that power,
she would dump his ass.

655
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:49,730
It's true.

656
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:52,983
Mariko would have never
gone through with the wedding...

657
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,652
not once the will was revealed.

658
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:57,529
She never took to me.

659
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,824
Oh, really?
A class act like you.

660
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:04,161
Shingen promised me
a fortune for my help.

661
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:08,874
So, you put a hit on his daughter.
Is that it?

662
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,002
Political careers don't last forever.

663
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:13,670
That's right.

664
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:15,839
Wait! Wait! No!

665
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,717
You wanted the truth.
I told you the truth!

666
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:21,428
I didn't like it.

667
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:23,430
Wow.

668
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:26,725
How did you know
there's a pool down there?

669
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,268
I didn't.

670
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:48,914
Did you know I studied
biology in college?

671
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,376
Genetics.

672
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,757
There are genes that skip generations.

673
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:01,093
Recessive genes.

674
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:04,721
Eyes.

675
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:05,806
Eyes. Hair.

676
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:08,392
Talent.

677
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,269
Temperament.

678
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:16,650
Not every child gets the same.

679
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,569
My father saw little of himself in me.

680
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,280
But in you...

681
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:25,075
he faced a mirror.

682
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:46,096
How did you convince my father...

683
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:47,764
to award you control...

684
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:49,433
of Asia's largest corporation?

685
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,309
You've gone insane.

686
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,646
I'm just waking up.

687
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:57,149
If you kill me, you will lose...

688
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,025
what little honor you have left.

689
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:01,945
I don't want to hurt you.

690
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,447
I want to help you.

691
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:05,323
Help you end your pain...

692
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:06,783
what that mutant stopped you...

693
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,285
from doing last week.

694
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:10,662
I never wanted to die, Father.

695
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:40,150
Where is the security?

696
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:01,296
Yakuza.

697
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:04,925
Shingen?

698
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,696
Logan.

699
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:38,875
This. This here.

700
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:40,669
Where is this?

701
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:45,882
Master Yashida's birthplace.

702
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:49,719
The company built a facility
into the mountainside.

703
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:54,724
How far?

704
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:58,019
500 kilometers from here.

705
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:53,700
I gotta get that thing out of me.

706
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,118
How?

707
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:56,703
No, stop, Logan.

708
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,455
I saw you die!

709
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,053
I saw you die in a room like this
with your heart in your hand.

710
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:15,138
I just can't leave her with
those freaks and killers.

711
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:18,433
I'm the only chance she's got,
but not with that thing inside me.

712
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:20,727
- You're going to die, Logan.
- Maybe that's okay.

713
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:23,563
No, listen to me, Logan!

714
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,732
No. stop. Logan!

715
01:22:26,816 --> 01:22:28,234
You're not gonna want
to watch this part.

716
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:30,904
No! Listen to me! Please, no!

717
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:34,074
No, stop. Listen to me.

718
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:36,409
Logan!

719
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:46,211
Move!

720
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:47,879
Stay away from him.

721
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:51,049
He killed your master.

722
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:54,427
Put hands on your sister.

723
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,554
And now you want him?

724
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:01,142
Oh, no.
I can't see.

725
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,979
You'll always be a beggar.

726
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:05,063
You're crazy.

727
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:14,447
Oh, no.

728
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:46,938
Yukio.

729
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:07,500
Logan!

730
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,801
Logan! Logan!

731
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:18,803
Logan!

732
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,181
Don't hit my friends.

733
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:07,352
Where's Mariko?

734
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:08,478
She's gone!

735
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:10,313
It was my fathers obsession...

736
01:25:10,313 --> 01:25:13,149
with mutation, with God's mistakes...

737
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:16,778
that ruined this house.

738
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:31,394
You tried to kill your daughter.

739
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:35,565
Live with that.

740
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,499
What kind
of monster are you?

741
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:55,960
The Wolverine.

742
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,005
I see you've come to fight.

743
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:05,340
It's pointless.

744
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,842
You're weak.
You're out numbered.

745
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:12,013
The Black Clan has protected the
House of Yashida for 700 years.

746
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:15,099
Is that all the men
you brought?

747
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:20,021
I'm gonna get her.

748
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:22,648
We are grateful for your
protection of Mariko.

749
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:25,943
But there is one more sacrifice
you must make for her family.

750
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,364
Go fuck yourself,
pretty boy.

751
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:30,461
Yukio, run!

752
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:19,302
Logan.

753
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,898
You're here.

754
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:36,819
Of course.

755
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:40,448
Can you stay?

756
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:44,619
I can't.

757
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:48,664
Yes, you can.

758
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,668
This is what you wanted.

759
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:56,172
Not anymore.

760
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:07,600
I love you, Jean.

761
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,982
I always will.

762
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:14,250
You are my only family.

763
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:18,170
Be well, sister.

764
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,812
Am I wrong to think
you might visit me soon?

765
01:35:46,365 --> 01:35:47,658
Stay.

766
01:35:49,326 --> 01:35:50,828
I can't, princess.

767
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,164
I'm a soldier,

768
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:54,999
and I've been
hiding too long.

769
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:11,390
In our business
profile tonight, Mariko Yashida.</i>

770
01:36:11,557 --> 01:36:14,351
A two-generation passing of the
torch in the Yashida family...

771
01:36:14,518 --> 01:36:17,271
as Mariko Yashida takes the
helm from her grandfather,

772
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:18,481
who built this tech giant.

773
01:36:18,647 --> 01:36:20,733
I know it will always be
the purpose

774
01:36:20,816 --> 01:36:22,902
for a corporation
to make a profit...

775
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:27,323
but Yashida Industries believes
we can also work with our community.

776
01:36:33,662 --> 01:36:35,873
So, have you decided?

777
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:39,335
What?

778
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:42,046
Mariko says we can
go wherever we want.

779
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:43,923
Just say where.

780
01:36:45,174 --> 01:36:46,509
What are you doing?

781
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:50,429
I'm your bodyguard.

782
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:56,644
So, where do you
want to go?

783
01:36:58,896 --> 01:36:59,939
Uh...

784
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,399
Let's just start with up.

785
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:04,235
And then?

786
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,949
We'll see.

787
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:13,619
Interesting.

788
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:07,483
With cutting edge technology,

789
01:39:07,566 --> 01:39:09,526
and the world's
leading minds...

790
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:11,278
we are on the frontlines...

791
01:39:11,445 --> 01:39:14,657
keeping you healthy,
keeping you safe.

792
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:17,201
Trask Industries.

793
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:19,662
Solving tomorrow's
problems, today.

794
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:21,956
I'll take the pat-down.

795
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:23,123
Opt out.

796
01:39:36,053 --> 01:39:37,221
You can go ahead, sir.

797
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:38,430
I'll wait.

798
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:48,524
What do you want?

799
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:52,778
There are dark forces,
Wolverine.

800
01:39:54,446 --> 01:39:56,532
Human forces
building a weapon...

801
01:39:56,699 --> 01:40:00,119
that could bring about
the end of our kind.

802
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:06,083
What do I want?
I want your help.

803
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:08,127
Why would I trust you?

804
01:40:09,294 --> 01:40:10,629
You wouldn't.

805
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,613
Hello, Logan.

806
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:42,828
How is this possible?

807
01:40:42,995 --> 01:40:45,748
As I told you
a long time ago...

808
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:49,585
you are not
the only one with gifts.
