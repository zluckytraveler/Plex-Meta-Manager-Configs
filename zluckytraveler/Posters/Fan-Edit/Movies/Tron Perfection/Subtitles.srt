9
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,214
Good evening. Our lead story.

10
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:34,052
ENCOM CEO and video game icon
Kevin Flynn has disappeared.

11
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,180
He was best known for designing Tron
and Space Paranoids,

12
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,016
the two bestselling video games
in history.

13
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,269
Flynn took ownership of ENCOM
in 1982

14
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,731
as the company skyrocketed
to the top of the tech industry.

15
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:51,152
But things changed in 1985
with the untimely death of Flynn's wife,

16
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,738
the mother of his young son, Sam.

17
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,824
Recently, ENCOM board members

18
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,158
have been troubled by reports

19
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,203
of Flynn's erratic,
even obsessive, behavior.

20
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,998
With Flynn missing,
the company is now in chaos.

21
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,334
This afternoon, ENCOM's board

22
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,587
moved to seize control
from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley,

23
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,674
vowing to return the company
to profitability.

24
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:17,971
Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains
his belief that Flynn is not missing

25
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,682
and is instead pursuing his dream of

26
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,227
"a digital frontier
to reshape the human condition."

27
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,771
TV: Even Flynn's
most ardent supporters

28
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,232
are now acknowledging a difficult truth.

29
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,110
Kevin Flynn may have simply
run away.

30
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,196
And while Flynn's loyalists
hope for his imminent return,

31
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,117
there is perhaps no one who wishes it
to happen more than young Sam Flynn,

32
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:43,329
now in the care of his grandparents,
and heir to an empire in turmoil.

33
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,000
SAM: He's coming. He promised.

34
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,085
- Sam, you have to eat.

and the future of ENCOM

he came to my house.

64
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,502
"I've cracked it," he kept saying.

65
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,839

00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,522
SAM: Yeah.

338
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,274
Till I dropped out.

339
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,693
(QUORRA LAUGHS)

340
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,868
Work?

341
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,330
- KEVIN: Job? ENCOM? Are you...
- No.

342
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,001
I check in once a year.

343
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,546
- Wife, girlfriend?
- Dog.

344
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,798
Marvin.

345
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,051
KEVIN: Well, dogs...
Dogs are cool.

346
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,689
I'm sure you must have
a few questions of your own, Sam.

347
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,069
Actually, just one.

348
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,449
Why I never came home.

349
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,039
Those nights when I went to the office,

350
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,459
I'm sure you've figured it out by now,
I was coming here.

351
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,380
Human form into digital space.

352
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,507
Heavy stuff.

353
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:50,262
But... I needed partners to help out.

354
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,725
I brought Tron here to protect this system. 

355
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:58,604
Clu was my creation,
designed to create a perfect world.

356
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,316
We were jamming, man,
building utopia.

357
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,111
Hours in here were just 
minutes back home.

358
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,406
Just when I thought
it couldn't get any more profound,

359
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,658
something unexpected happened.

360
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,954
ISOs. Isomorphic algorithms.

361
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:19,458
- A whole new life form.
- And you created them?

362
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,585
(LAUGHS)

363
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,548
No. No.

364
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:29,218
They manifested, like a flame.

365
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:32,221
They weren't really from anywhere.

366
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:35,182
The conditions were right
and they came into being.

367
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:40,062
I found them in here.
Like flowers in a wasteland.

368
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,858
They were spectacular.

369
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,777
Everything I'd hoped to find
in the system,

370
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,363
control, order, perfection,

371
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,823
none of it meant a thing.

372
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,199
I'd been living in a hall of mirrors.

373
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,327
SAM: So what happened?

374
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:59,999
KEVIN: Clu. Clu happened.

375
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:06,464
KEVIN: Tron, he fought for me.

376
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,640
I never saw him again.

377
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,896
Clu saw the ISOs as an imperfection.

378
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,858
So he destroyed them.
(DISTANT SCREAMING)

379
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,152
"The Purge."

380
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,823
- He killed them all?
- It was genocide.

381
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,994
I tried to get back
but I couldn't get to the portal.

382
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,165
It closed on me, Sam.

383
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,001
That's why I never came home.

384
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,593
SAM: So the portal...

385
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,677
It's open now.

386
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:54,970
KEVIN: Not for long.

387
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,681
Only one millicycle, about eight hours.

388
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:01,185
So we go now. Go home.
We make a run for it.

389
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,395
- We get you out of here.
- Don't rush.

390
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,648
What do you mean?
The portal's gonna close.

391
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,318
What? What is it?

392
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:13,489
The moment Flynn is on the Grid, Clu
will stop at nothing to obtain his disk.

393
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,368
Clu figures if I can be in...

394
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,161
SAM: He can be out?

395
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,790
KEVIN: With my disk, it's possible.
SAM: And then what?

396
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,167
Game over.

397
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,837
The guy doesn't dig imperfection.

398
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,093
So what do we do? Nothing?

399
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,096
It's amazing how productive
doing nothing can be.

400
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,808
Clu's planning something.
We've known that for a while.

401
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,601
Programs have been disappearing.

402
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,312
There's unrest out there,
even revolution.

403
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:49,608
If we sit tight, Clu might
be brought down from the inside.

404
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,028
SAM: If the portal is closing, we can't
sit around. We have to move now.

405
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:57,950
Tell me, what brought you here,
to the Grid?

406
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,452
Alan got your page.

407
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,289
I didn't send any page.

408
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,040
It was Clu.

409
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:08,002
Clu sent that page.
That's why you're here.

410
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,088
This is all his design.
He wanted a new piece

411
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,591
on the board to change the game!

412
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,759
With you, he got more
than he ever dreamed.

413
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:21,015
This is precisely what he wants.
Us together heading for the portal.

414
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:25,269
It's his game now.
The only way to win is not to play.

415
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,189
Well, that's a hell of a way to live.

416
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,609
Goodnight, Sam.

417
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,134
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

418
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,429
I mean, he built Clu.
Why doesn't he just end him?

419
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,766
He could,
but it would require reintegration.

420
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,351
Yeah, all right.

421
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,146
Flynn would never survive the event.
It would mean the end of them both.

422
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,732
I'm going through the portal.

423
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,567
Clu wants Flynn's disk, not mine.

424
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:17,821
I'm going to find Alan and we'll figure
this thing out from the other side.

425
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:22,034
This may be Clu's game here, but
in my world, he's gone in one keystroke.

426
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,412
But I can't do anything
unless I get to the portal.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

There's someone I once knew,

00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,914
a program named Zuse
who fought alongside the ISOs.

430
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,292
They say he can get anyone anywhere.

431
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,004
SAM: How do I find him?

QUORRA: This is his sector.

433

Make it there alive, and he'll find you.

- Yeah. You gave me some advice.
- And you followed it.

00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,505
All the angles.

497
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,423
So when do I meet him?

498
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,429
You just did.
(LAUGHS)

499
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:25,642
After the Purge,
I needed to reinvent myself.

500
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,978
Self-preservation, you understand.

501
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:37,612
Now, what can I do for you?

502
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,367
I need to get to the portal.

503
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,952
Well, it's closing quickly,

504
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,705
as I'm sure you're aware.

505
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,290
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

506
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,625
And it's quite the journey.

507
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,503
Beyond the far reaches of the Outlands.

508
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:59,217
- Can you help me?
- Of course.

509
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,555
But first, as a man who prides himself
on staying well informed,

510
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,141
I must ask who sent you my way.

511
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,271
Her name's Quorra.

512
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,440
Said she met you a long time ago.

513
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,610
Indeed she did.

514
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,445
Many cycles ago.

515
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,240
It was a different time.

516
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:26,203
But we're not here to relive the past.
Let's see about your future, shall we?

517
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,914
We'll have to change your attire

518
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:32,292
and you'll need a forged disk.
Not easy these days.

519
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,127
And of course you'll need transport

520
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,173
to cross the Sea of Simulation.

521
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,978
This is going to be quite the ride.

522
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,025
(SCREAMING)

523
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,446
I believed in users once before.

524
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,756
The game has changed, son of Flynn!

525
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,768
(CACKLES)

526
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,526
I met your friend. He's fantastic!

527
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:43,029
Behold! The son of our maker!

528
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,461
(LAUGHS)

529
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,842
Yeah, yeah!

530
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,429
Yeah, yeah!

531
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,638
(GROANS)

(MUSIC STOPS)

533
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,545
Go, go!

534
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,011
Let's split, man.

535
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:03,610
(BEEPS)

536
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,029
(SCREAMING)

00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,489
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

538
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,569
SAM: Your disk.

539
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,613
Dad, it's gone.

540
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,949
It is.

541
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,495
I'm sorry. I know I messed up.

542
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,415
We can go back.

543
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,209
- I can go back.
- No, we stay together.

544
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:04,295
- Dad, I can do this.
- You've done enough already!

545
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,762
SAM: So what do we do now?

546
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,392
You ever jump a freight train?

547
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,602
Huh?

548
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,897
We do it your way.
Full-on sprint to the portal.

549
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,858
If we beat Clu there, we have a chance.

550
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,234
Let's get her out of here.

551
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,740
- Is she gonna make it?
- I don't know.

552
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,493
I've got to identify the damaged code.

553
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:20,121
The sequencing
is just enormously complex.

554
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:25,919
- SAM: But didn't you write it?
- Some of it. The rest of it is just

555
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:31,341
beyond me.

556
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,928
She's an ISO.

557
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,430
KEVIN: Yeah. The last ISO.

558
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,142
SAM: All this time,

559
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,561
you were just protecting her.

560
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,657
(LAUGHS) Check that out.

561
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,917
She risked herself for me.

562
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,213
Some things are worth the risk.

563
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,728
KEVIN: Look at this.

564
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:32,193
Now, that is impressive
if I do say so myself. Huh?

565
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:36,823
Come on, it's gonna take a while
for her system to reboot.

566
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,428
CLU: The boy and Flynn are gone.

567
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:02,348
CASTOR: I presume, Your Excellency,
they perished in the elevator.

568
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,353
You presume?

569
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,691
Find them.

570
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,698
Cell phones, online dating, Wi-Fi.

571
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,868
- KEVIN: What's Wi-Fi?
- Wireless interlinking.

572
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,829
- Of digital devices?
- Yeah.

573
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,333
Hmm. I thought of that in '85.

574
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,585
(LAUGHS)

575
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,089
Mom and Dad are...

576
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,052
- I assume that...
- Yeah.

577
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,304
Oh.

578
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,682
Mac when I was 12

579
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,685
and Gram five years later.

580
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:54,359
You remember that night
when you didn't come home?

581
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,652
- Well...
- You said...

582
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,820
I said I'd show you the Grid.

583
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,200
You should have seen this place
back then.

584
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:08,456
I couldn't wait to show it to you.
Could not wait.

585
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:11,042
SAM: Must have been something
before Clu screwed it up.

586
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,877
No, no, he...

587
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,340
He's me. I screwed it up.

588
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,927
Chasing after perfection.

589
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:26,724
Chasing after
what was right in front of me.

590
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,729
Look what you've accomplished.

591
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,898
It's incredible.

592
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,358
Sam,

593
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,612
I'd have given it all up
for one more day with you.

594
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,537
(SIGHS)

595
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,751
Hey.

596
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,546
Remember your old Ducati?

597
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,924
You kidding? Not a day goes by
I don't think about that bike.

598
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:04,011
- Yeah, well, I'm fixing her up.
- You busted my bike?

599
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:09,767
Twenty years in the shed, no tarp.
I mean, she needed a little love.

600
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,310
(LAUGHS)

601
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,937
How does she run?

602
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:17,024
Well, when I'm done, better than ever.

603
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,778
Well, man, I'd like to see that.

604
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,948
You will.

605
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:28,369
Here.

606
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,164
She's rebooting. Give her this.

607
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:35,084
The old man's gonna knock on the sky,
listen to the sound.

608
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:06,991
I presume our
 understanding is still valid?

609
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,661
A sizeable request, I know.

610
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:13,581
But seemingly fitting compensation.

611
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,625
Don't you think?

612
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:20,254
Just imagine the secrets it holds.

613
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,302
But there's something else, too.

614
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,054
Isn't there?

615
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,014
I've heard the chatter

616
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:33,476
about this private initiative.

617
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:46,072
I realize that our alliance is,

01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,573
at times,

619
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,116
uneasy.

620
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,202
But always necessary.

621
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,622
You know you need me

622
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,749
right where I am.

623
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,709
Of course you're right.

624
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,295
Enjoy the drink.

We're heading east towards the portal.

01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:27,488
Clu has the disk.

631
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:31,033
Once I get out, I can shut him down.

632
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,706
I should never have sent you to Zuse.
It was a mistake.

633
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:39,250
It's okay. I've made a few myself.

634
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,382
Where is he?

635
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:50,177
SAM: I think he's knocking on the sky.

636
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,430
QUORRA: And listening to the sound.

637
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,099
Yeah.

638
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,685
How did you find him?

01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,279
It's okay.

640
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,491
I know.

QUORRA: It was during the Purge.

642
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,169
Clu was relentless.

643
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,923
The Black Guard were executing ISOs
in the streets.

644
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,801
Everyone I knew disappeared.

645
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:35,514
Then they came for me.

646
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,186
So I ran.

647
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:43,606
But soon they had me surrounded.

648
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,733
I prepared for the end.

649
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,277
And just as everything was going dark,

650
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,822
I felt a hand on my shoulder.

651
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:56,577
And when I opened my eyes,

652
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,458
standing above me was your father.

653
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:06,212
He saved me.

that Flynn was here.

It became the symbol
of something bigger,

something better than this world.

658
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:38,536
I've never been this close before.

659
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:42,248
It's how I imagine a sunrise to be.
