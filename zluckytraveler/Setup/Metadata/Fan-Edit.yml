    summary: This uses The Assembly Cut as it's base and introduces Theatrical Cut elements that I have a preference for. I also attempt to clean up the colour and contrast imbalances in certain composite shots. I also add extra FX for dramatic effect in places, to improve visually on the original or to technically facilitate differences in lighting between the 2 versions when using footage for the same scenes.

    summary: These two edits (ALIEN V rt 132min and ALIEN COVENANT:EXTENDED CUT rt 154 min) restore the three act structure by creating a new first act from supplemental and deleted material. There is also a new Coda, tightened up restored scenes to develop character and score and audio enhancements to give it a more ALIEN feel all over.

    summary: Inspired by my media teacher's hatred for the early Hadley's Hope scenes in Aliens (the only reason that we watched the theatrical cut in class was due to these 2 scenes in the SE), I've created my own cut as a half way point between the Special Edition and the Theatrical without the Hadley's Hope sequence.

    summary: The original 160-minute 'Theatrical Cut' of 'Amadeus' that won multiple Oscars and BAFTAs in 1984 only exists on an old poor quality 1998 PAL "flipper" DVD (and Laserdisc and VHS). Every release since then (including all blu-rays) has been the 180-minute 'Director's Cut'. I simply wanted to cut the DC blu-ray to match the TC DVD, so I have both cuts as an option.

    summary: Scenes were cut, that are out of character and using alternate and deleted material from the movie to give it a different feel. It also has rescored scenes with different music to recontextualize or emphasize different moments in the movie.

    summary: There is a new opening recap to the ending of Part 1 and a subsequent scene not seen in Part 1. The tone is less cartoonish, more balanced, and there is a lot of new music with deleted material used to flesh out the movie. Much like Part 1 the focus is on Peter and Gwen's relationship without all the other distractions.

    summary: Good intentions wreak havoc when Tony Stark unwittingly creates Ultron, a terrifying A.I. monster who vows to achieve "world peace" via mass extinction.

    summary: "An epic two-in-one edit of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Seamlessly combining the two films, along with credits scenes from Ant-Man and the Wasp and Captain Marvel. Additionally, there has been much cut from both films to remove some of the crappy dialogue and humour, to make for the most digestible and tolerable rewatch experience."

    summary: "Batman: The Man Who Laughs tries to amplify the strengths of The Dark Knight while omitting some of its weaknesses. Pacing is tightened up, some scenes are restructured, rescored, reordered, or omitted altogether. Lines of dialogue and humor that seemed out of place omitted as well. I usually fanedit awful movies. Here I wanted to take a very good movie and make it the best it could be."

    summary: The main problem with 'Blade Runner 2049' was the insanely slow pace of the editing/cutting. Every line had a vast gap after it and every shot lingered for too long, even if nothing whatsoever was happening in the shot and the camera was motionless. I love long movies but when a film is nearly 3-hours, careless and lax editing is a crime. It's like they assembled all the footage and forgot to go through and tighten everything up like a good editor should. So I was interested in making a cut of this film that focused (almost) entirely on improving the pace of the cuts. The same film/experience but edited properly. An experiment in doing a fanedit that doesn't actually remove anything!

    summary: What would a modern day Blade Runner score by Vangelis sound like? This edit rescores Blade Runner 2049 with new music from the composer’s 2016 album Rosetta and his Blade Runner tribute album from 2007. The music is supplemented by some earlier Vangelis tracks, as well as material by John Barry and others. No music from the original Blade Runner is used, except when sampled by Vangelis on the BR tribute album. In addition, the edit is approx. 15 minutes shorter, mainly from trimming Wallace’s scenes to a minimum and cutting Gaff and Rachael.

    summary: This edit includes various visual and audio elements from all released versions of Blade Runner in an attempt to make it the best available presentation with a few narrative edits for personal preference. Most notable inclusions are the technical updates from The Final Cut, with the visual elements re-graded to match the legacy colour tones of the previous releases - and particular attention being paid to literally preserving the original portions of the legacy frames as well as grading the changes where masking was appropriate. The film's narrative follows more closely the Workprint and tacitly rejects Ridley Scott's attempts to render the human/replicant philosophical analogue as effectively superficial. This version takes out any connection to references made by Scott in interviews and indeed the Director's Cut relating to Deckard's origins. Instead this film is content to literally study/contrast the philosophical state of all the humanity on display or lack thereof from all participants.

    summary: Batman Begins is a great origin story, establishing the gritty and realistic tone that would come to define Nolan's trilogy. Unfortunately, the film is also weighed down by numerous issues, including clunky exposition, poor attempts at humour, distracting CGI effects, and an overly yellow colour grade in many scenes. This edit attempts to fix those issues, hopefully strengthening this already great film and allowing its stronger elements to shine through.

    summary: The Dark Knight is undoubtedly the crowning achievement of Nolan's Bat-Trilogy. It is rightly considered a classic of modern cinema, however, it is still victim to many of the flaws that plague the trilogy as a whole, including poor humour, weak performances from supporting characters, clunky exposition and jarring narrative details. This edit attempts to tighten up The Dark Knight, trimming those elements that detracted from this wonderful film, hopefully allowing what remains to be all the more enjoyable as a result.

    summary: The Dark Knight Rises has some of the strongest elements of the trilogy, but is ultimately weighed down by its bloated running time, illogical narrative (especially in the 3rd act), jokey one-liners, and arguably, the failure to stick the landing in the film's final moments. This edit aims to strip down the finale of Nolan's trilogy to its core, emphasising the stronger aspects of the story and hopefully offering a more emotionally satisfying conclusion to Batman's story as a whole.

    summary: Die Hard is the pinnacle of action movie goodness in my opinion and cannot be improved upon as its completely perfect as it is. However as its one of my favourite films I was intrigued whether I could put a different spin on it to give it some fresh appeal. It struck me that as McClane spends nearly the entire runtime of the movie apart from all the other protagonists I could maybe use splitscreen to give the impression of multiple events taking place at once. Thus the idea for Die Hard 'til Midnight was born, and the edit evolved as a Die Hard/24 style (semi) real-time thriller.

There are many, many movie and pop culture references throughout; there's a new soundtrack, alternate dialog, new visual effects (some so subtle only the most hardcore The Thing fans will notice) and more Easter eggs than Palmer's got dutchies. Basically, I threw everything but the kitchen sink at this Thing.

    summary: The theatrical cut was full of lines which were very on the nose. Additionally, there was a subplot, involving Motoko's mother, that went nowhere. These issues have been addressed in the Lean & Mean cut. Moreover the beginning of the movie was re-edited to mimic the way the original animated movie starts. To this purpose, the credits scene was rescored using Kenji Kaway new rendition of the original main theme. Scenes from the very beginning of the movie have been used to create a flashback sequence that now appears much later. Multiple scenes where shortened, lines of dialogues were either deleted or altered or used in different contexts. The cemetery scene was restored to its original state and purpose. As far as I can tell, in the theatrical cut it was sliced in 2 to accomodate for the character of Motoko's mother, which I presumed was added at a later time to address the whitewashing controversy and to make up for the deleted scenes which included the character of Paz.

Additional music scores and creative changes supplement the narrative and film experience. The twist is that it focuses more on the relationship between Dr. Loomis and Michael rather than Laurie and Michael.

    summary: Over half of the cumulative running time of the films have been cut. What was once a bloated, 542-minute trilogy is now a more digestible 247-minute epic. In general, I’ve tried to keep the spirit of the book intact by removing unnecessary subplots, characters, ridiculous action scenes, and so on.

    summary: Going to see Crystal Skull on opening night is probably the worst cinematic experience I've ever had. You could just feel the room deflate, all the energy disappear, the excitement turned to disappointment. I hated it. However, time has been kinder than expected to the film. Maybe it's comparing it to what passes for modern "adventure" filmmaking, but it's sort of outdated style kind of works in its favor. There's a lot of things that do work about it. Harrison Ford and the rest of the cast are game. Though it's kind of a "left hand" movie from Spielberg, he's still the greatest movie director of our lifetimes, so it's still got some great visuals and action. The story could be intriguing.

    label: FanFix
    summary: This edit aims to eradicate the paternal cause of some questionable narrative that essentially removed the viewer from the fantasy of adventure and also other complaints I had with the level of schlock falling lower than was necessary. It also aims to strike a balance for those that didn’t mind or could live with certain things like cgi bugs or iconic atomic silhouettes... Cutting the best part of twenty minutes was as far as I’d like to go to try to keep a feature length feel. There be aliens ahead, but differently presented...

    summary: Recut the 3 episodes (126minutes) into a single movie (100minutes). I streamlined the narrative by focusing on only two story arcs -- Barry and Ollie. Gone is the Kid Flash and Prof. Stein subplots as they are unnecessary to drive the main plot. Also, significantly cut the Arrow episode so it feels less like an anniversary celebration episode, thus stopping the story dead in its tracks, and more like it is part of the Dominator's plan.

    summary: Die Another Day should have been celebration of everything good about the James Bond franchise. Unfortunately, in trying to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the screen in celebration of 007's 40th anniversary, director Lee Tamahori and the producers ended up with an unfocused movie, riddled with poor innuendo jokes and some ill-advised ventures into the more fantasy CGI arena. The hope with Icarus, is to redress the balance and uncover what I believe is a genuinely good old-fashioned large scale Bond adventure. No invisible car, no CGI tsunami surfing heroics, the poor jokes removed, Icarus attempts to give Pierce Brosnan the Bond swansong he deserved.

There are several 10-minute chunks of this edit that are unchanged (aside from the regrade) but when I did change something, I hope it feels significant. "

The theory states that Wilford (or Wilford Wonka in this case) is actually Charlie Bucket who has inherited the role of Willy Wonka.

    summary: The first of the revamped '9000 series', Cloak of Deception delivers a re-crafted perspective on Star Wars Episode I in keeping with the drive of the original trilogy of films. Unnecessary 'galaxy shrinking' cameos from classic characters have been cut down or removed. Anakin is depicted as a more mature and capable figure an audience can identify with.

Anakin's fall to the dark side is portrayed in a more believable way, with political motivations that are ignited by, rather than preceded by, a desire to save his wife. Padme's role is expanded, and her fate is made to match her daughter's memories.

    summary: Rise of the Rebellion is a light fanfix of what I consider to be the second best Star Wars movie currently released. This edit differs from others in that it does not drastically reduce the length, narrative focus of the movie or add any John Williams cues. Rise of the Rebellion seeks to restore heroes to the movie by slightly shifting their motivations and actions to produce a story that is filled with brave heroes and less distractions.

    summary: In typical fashion, exposition gets cut drastically. The last time something is explained, is hopefully the only time it is. My intent is to leave some mystery and suspense, and not everyone needs to be a main character. I didn't know these characters besides Harley before watching, and that is the perspective I maintain. Slipknot is simply a plot device, not a main character.

Whilst many people enjoyed Taika Waititi's unique blend of humour and emotion, There are many people who felt he had taken it too far. Thor Love and Thunder Minus Comedy takes the worst of the comedy out and aims to focus on Thor's emotional journey, rediscovering love and accentuating the threatening presence of Gorr the god-butcher. Thor discovers that Gorr is aiming to kill all gods and sets out on a mission to raise an army to rescue the abducted children of Asgard. It's not yet clear how this army will come about but on the way, he meets the enigmatic Zeus whose allegiances are never quite clear, and rekindles a romance with Jane Foster who has her own secrets.

    summary: Tron Perfection is a story about the conflict of man vs himself, and less about Sam Flynn (who is merely our entry-point into the Grid.) Kevin Flynn spent so much in his crusade to get revenge on Dillinger in the original Tron that once he got his revenge, made Clu, and set about to create a new Grid, he was mirroring comparable character flaws that included massive ambition married to a sense of entitlement.

    summary: "This is a sequel to THE WAR OF THE STARS: A NEW HOPE GRINDHOUSED, released in 2010. The goal is now to mix “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi” while taking care of the changes made for the first edit. A lot of deleted scenes are also back in this edit. Some hopefully intertaining twists and more than 90 new special effects turn this project into something that I think is special even if maybe not as “fun” as the first edit. Or fun in another kind of way."

    summary: This fanedit was crafted to recapture some of the spirit, story structure, and character depth of the original comic books by reorganizing/trimming scenes, adding new content from the “Under the Hood” documentary, replacing music to change the tone of various scenes, as well as cutting out silly stunts and other material that did not fit the tone of the original comics.

    summary: This is a new take on DANCES WITH WOLVES, the famous 4h Western/Adventure that is so similar in its story to Avatar. Condensed to 2h30 minutes this is a much faster paced intense movie with no voice overs from John Dunbar, no irritating madness and less over-the-top scenes. The conflict of the two worlds and clashing cultures has been toned down to a more realistic, but still highly emotional take.

    summary: Diana kept fighting after the events of her first movie in smaller, more hidden humanitarian ways, even though she gave up hope in mankind as a whole. We do not find her in the 80s anti-social and still brooding about Steve this whole time. Instead she is a confident hidden hero, who happens upon a chance that brings him back, and she realizes AGAIN how much she lost. This movie becomes the reason she still thinks about him in the present day JL movies. She was over him in that she knew he was gone the first time, only to have him come back for a while and let him go again. She essentially gets PTSD from this experience, instead of just being lovesick for the full 100 years. (Also, Steve is not inhabiting anyone else’s body in this edit.) WW84 also should have dialed up the 80's soundtrack. Bill and Teds was shot in '87 and released in '89, so I already knew I couldn't lock myself into ‘84 if I wanted to mix the soundtracks. Bill and ted's gave me tons of source material to work with, but I needed more, so since Bill and Ted wanted to work with Van Halen, Van Halen leads the additional songs needed. There is also Judas Priest, Pat Benatar, The Expressions, Killing Joke, Vangelis, Oingo Boingo, Def Leppard, Scorpions, Harold Faltermayer and Kenny Loggins.
